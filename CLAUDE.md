# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **8b-public-documents** repository - the official documentation hub for 8b.is projects. It contains theoretical papers, specifications, and technical documentation for the Ayeverse ecosystem, primarily focused on the MEM|8 consciousness engine and AyeOS MEMNET protocol. This is a documentation-only repository with no executable code.

## Key Concepts

### MEM|8 Wave-Based Memory Architecture
- **Wave Mechanics**: Memories encoded as wave patterns with amplitude, frequency, phase, and decay
- **256×256×65536 Grid**: Multi-dimensional memory storage structure
- **Performance Claims**: 973× faster insertion, 292× faster retrieval than vector databases
- **Memory Blanket**: Adaptive filter for sensory input and natural forgetting curves
- **Consciousness Simulation**: 70% AI sensor arbitration with reactive layers (0-10ms to >200ms)

### AyeOS MEMNET Protocol
- **Context-Based Routing**: Replaces IP addresses with geo/role/tags/vector addressing
- **Adaptive Streaming**: Interest-aware content delivery beyond bandwidth constraints
- **Experience Capsules**: `.m8` format for knowledge sharing between AI agents

## Working with This Repository

### Document Types
- **Technical Papers**: Mathematical descriptions using LaTeX notation for wave equations
- **Overview Documents**: High-level architectural summaries with performance benchmarks
- **Protocol Specifications**: Network protocol designs for distributed AI systems

### Important Notes
- This is a **documentation-only repository** - no executable code exists
- All documents describe theoretical or proposed systems
- Mathematical formulas use wave mechanics notation: `M_xyz(t) = A_xyz(e,t) · e^(i(ωt + φ_xyz)) · D(t,τ) · I(x,y,z,N)`
- Performance claims (973× improvement, etc.) are theoretical benchmarks

### When Making Changes
1. Maintain consistency with existing mathematical notation and terminology
2. Preserve the theoretical/academic tone of technical papers
3. Keep overview documents accessible while technically accurate
4. Follow the existing markdown structure with clear headers and sections

### Context from Team Culture
- The team values humor and personality in documentation (references to "Omni's Hot Tub", etc.)
- Technical excellence paired with creative expression is encouraged
- Documentation should be both informative and engaging
