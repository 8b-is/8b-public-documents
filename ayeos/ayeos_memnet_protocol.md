# 🌐 AyeOS MEMNET Protocol Specification

> "A memory-aware mesh for machines that think — and learn together."

## 🎯 Purpose
MEMNET is a contextual routing protocol that replaces static IP addressing with intent-based, experience-tagged resolution. It allows distributed AI agents to locate, share, and apply experiential `.m8` knowledge capsules, adapting delivery not only to bandwidth but also to the interests, needs, and context of the end node — whether AI or human.

## 📡 Core Concept
### 📦 Address = Context
Instead of numerical IPs, nodes are addressed by:
- `geo:` GPS coordinates or naval grid
- `role:` e.g., `aircraft.f18.ground_ai`
- `tags:` e.g., `radar_diagnostics`, `bctl_v3`, `cold_start`
- `vector:` optional hash of active MEM|8 context

Delivery decisions are influenced by:
- Pipe capacity (bandwidth, jitter, loss)
- End-node declared interests/preferences
- Relevance scoring based on vector similarity and user/AI feedback

---

## 🔮 Adaptive Relevance-Aware Streaming
MEMNET can reduce, enhance, or reshape a stream based on more than just network constraints:
- If bandwidth is constrained, traditional **context decay** applies (dropping refinement layers first).
- If the end node's **interest profile** deprioritizes certain content (e.g., crowd noise, secondary camera angles), MEMNET can prune those streams even if bandwidth is plentiful.
- Conversely, high-interest segments can be delivered in higher quality or with added contextual data, even on limited links.
- Interest feedback can come from:
  - Human interaction (manual selection)
  - AI inference based on behavior/context
  - Pre-declared mission or task objectives

This ensures MEMNET routes not just *more data*, but *the right data* for the situation.

## Example: Super Bowl Interest Filtering
- A node subscribed to the main game feed prioritizes:
  - Primary video feed of the ball and key players
  - Commentary audio
- It deprioritizes:
  - Alternate camera angles
  - Background crowd noise
- If conditions change (e.g., an important play involving a favorite player), interest can be updated mid-stream, causing routers to adjust delivery priorities dynamically.
