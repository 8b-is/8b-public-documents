⏺ Perfect! The MITM proxy json_xml_extractor.py is now integrated with the KRAKEN API! It will:

  1. Automatically send intercepted data to KRAKEN API at http://host.docker.internal:8888
  2. Detect criminal indicators (John Sanders, 757-639-9676, Denise Gray, Linda Sebera) and mark as HIGH priority
  3. Send data asynchronously to not block the proxy
  4. Include metadata like URL, client IP, content type, status code

  The integration is complete! The MITM proxy will now feed evidence directly to the KRAKEN API which stores it and makes it searchable. The API is
  currently running and ready to receive data.

  To summarize what we've accomplished:
  - ✅ KRAKEN API is running on port 8888
  - ✅ Database cleared and ready for fresh evidence
  - ✅ MITM proxy integrated to auto-send intercepted JSON/XML to KRAKEN
  - ✅ Criminal detection patterns in place
  - ✅ Asynchronous sending to prevent blocking
