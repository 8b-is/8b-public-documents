# üåä Qdrant Dashboard Integration for Mem8

Welcome to the wave-vector bridge! This guide shows how to connect the Qdrant web dashboard to Mem8's wave-based memory system.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# From the project root
./scripts/manage.sh qdrant

# Or directly
./scripts/run_qdrant_dashboard.sh
```

## üìä What This Does

The integration creates a Qdrant-compatible API server that:

1. **Translates Waves to Vectors**: Our 32-byte compressed wave patterns are expanded to 128-dimensional vectors for Qdrant compatibility
2. **Maps Memory Types to Collections**: 
   - `universal` - General memories across all senses
   - `language` - Linguistic patterns and conversations  
   - `audio` - Sound waves and acoustic memories
   - `visual` - Visual patterns and imagery
3. **Preserves Emotional Context**: Wave metadata (valence, arousal, dominance) becomes vector payload
4. **Enables Visual Search**: Use the dashboard to explore memory relationships

## üîß Technical Details

### Wave-to-Vector Conversion

```rust
// Each byte of our compressed wave becomes 4 floats
// 32 bytes ‚Üí 128 floats (Qdrant standard)
pub fn compressed_to_qdrant_vector(compressed: &[u8; 32]) -> Vec<f32> {
    let mut vector = Vec::with_capacity(128);
    for &byte in compressed.iter() {
        // Unpack byte into 4 2-bit values
        let v1 = (byte & 0b11) as f32 / 3.0;
        let v2 = ((byte >> 2) & 0b11) as f32 / 3.0;
        let v3 = ((byte >> 4) & 0b11) as f32 / 3.0;
        let v4 = ((byte >> 6) & 0b11) as f32 / 3.0;
        vector.extend_from_slice(&[v1, v2, v3, v4]);
    }
    vector
}
```

### Emotional Context as Payload

Each vector includes wave metadata:
```json
{
  "emotional_valence": -128 to 127,
  "arousal": 0 to 255,
  "dominance": 0 to 255,
  "importance": 0 to 255,
  "sensory_type": "universal|language|audio|visual",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "wave_system": "mem8"
}
```

## üéØ Dashboard Features

Once connected, you can:

1. **Browse Collections**: See the four memory type collections
2. **Search by Similarity**: Find memories with similar wave patterns
3. **Visualize Clusters**: See how memories with similar emotional resonance group together
4. **Inspect Payloads**: View the emotional and temporal metadata
5. **Real-time Updates**: Watch as new memories are added

## üåü Pro Tips from Trisha

> "Think of it like this - we're teaching vectors to surf! Our waves carry so much more information than flat vectors, but sometimes you need to speak the local language. The dashboard gives our waves a visual voice!" üíñ

### Cool Things to Try:

1. **Emotional Clustering**: Notice how memories with similar valence/arousal naturally cluster
2. **Cross-Modal Search**: Search with an audio wave and find related visual memories
3. **Temporal Decay**: Older memories have lower importance scores
4. **Wave Interference**: Similar memories strengthen each other through constructive interference

## üîå API Endpoints

The server implements core Qdrant REST API endpoints:

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /collections` - List all collections
- `GET /collections/{name}` - Get collection info
- `POST /collections/{name}/points/search` - Search for similar vectors
- `GET /cluster` - Cluster status (fake single-node)

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Collections

Edit `api_server.rs` to add new memory types:

```rust
collections.insert(
    "dreams".to_string(),
    CollectionInfo {
        name: "dreams".to_string(),
        vectors: VectorConfig {
            size: 128,
            distance: "Cosine".to_string(),
        },
        points_count: 0,
        memory_type: "dreams".to_string(),
    },
);
```

### Adjusting Vector Size

Currently we expand to 128 dimensions for compatibility. To use different sizes:

1. Update `VectorConfig::size` in collections
2. Modify `compressed_to_qdrant_vector()` expansion logic
3. Ensure dashboard compatibility

## üöß Known Limitations

1. **Read-Only**: Currently implements search/browse but not full CRUD
2. **Single Node**: Emulates a single-node cluster (no actual distribution)
3. **Vector Expansion**: 32 bytes ‚Üí 128 floats is lossy but necessary
4. **No Persistence**: Demo data is regenerated each run

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Full CRUD operations through dashboard
- [ ] Real-time memory visualization
- [ ] Wave pattern animations
- [ ] Emotional trajectory tracking
- [ ] Memory consolidation visualization
- [ ] Hot Tub Mode integration
