# Script Organization Complete âœ…

## What We Did

### 1. **Organized Scripts by Category**
- Created `scripts/` subdirectories:
  - `audio/` - 15 audio-related scripts
  - `testing/` - 3 testing scripts  
  - `bitnet/` - 3 AI integration scripts
  - `development/` - 1 development tool

### 2. **Created Documentation**
- **SCRIPTS.md** - Complete documentation for all scripts
  - Describes each script's purpose
  - Shows usage examples
  - Explains conventions
  - Documents how to add new scripts

### 3. **Updated Integration**
- Modified `README.md` to reference script documentation
- Enhanced `manage.sh` with `scripts` command
- Kept `manage.sh` wrapper in root for backwards compatibility

### 4. **Benefits**
- âœ… No more cluttered root directory
- âœ… Easy to find scripts by category
- âœ… Clear documentation for each script
- âœ… Consistent organization
- âœ… Better for new contributors
