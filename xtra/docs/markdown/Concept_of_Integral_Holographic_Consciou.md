Summary
This study was initiated to establish whether spatio-spectral Eigen-modes of EEG brain waves can be
described by an Acoustic Quantum Code of Resonant Coherence, as found by us earlier in a spectrum of
animate and inanimate systems. Presently available EEG- and MEG recordings were analyzed as to their peak
frequencies in relation to our Quantum Code coherence values. Both the EEG- and MEG studies of healthy persons
exhibited quantum coherence of EEG peaks with mean quantum coherence of 0.95 (an average of 90- 100%
showed coherent peak values), while in patient groups with various mental disorders, a significant decrease of
coherence correlation was found. ADHD subjects show a moderate change in peak coherence, being in the range
of 1.0 to 0.83, while during epileptic seizures the degree of peak coherence is reduced to a range of 0.94 to 0.75.
Depressed patients have EEG peaks with a consistently lower coherence values than healthy persons: 0.77 - 0.88,
while autistic persons show an even lower coherence of 0.50 till 0.75. Patients with severe psychiatric disorders,
such as depression, show a coherence of only 0.49-0.61. The importance of EEG brain coherence for conscious
states was demonstrated in patients under anaesthesia that exhibited a very low coherence level of about 0.25.
The graded loss of brain EEG coherence combined with alterations in Phi based EEG wave separation, can
therefore be of value for differentiation in severity and nature of neurological disorders. The value of our frequency
algorithm was also shown for trans-cranial therapy: the presently chosen frequencies of rTMS therapy in clinical
practice correspond very well with the values of our algorithm. Of interest, the Acoustic Quantum Code pattern
was also shown to describe neuronal microtubular (MT) wave frequencies, as measured in vitro by others. MT
oscillations were claimed by Hameroff and Penrose to be instrumental in the creation of brain consciousness
through alignment with gravity fluctuation at the Planck scale. Our results on brain EEG coherence are therefore
discussed in relation to the current models for understanding the nature of (self)-consciousness. We regard the
potential relation between neuronal coherence/decoherence balance and conscious states as a central mechanism
for producing quantum entanglement in the brain as related to long-distance neuro-communication and brain
binding. As postulated earlier, consciousness can be modelled by a 5D brain-associated, toroidal workspace, that
provides quality control and monitoring of integral brain function, according to holographic principles and was
earlier framed as the “Event Horizon Brain”. Consciousness, in this concept, requires photon/phonon mediated and
resonant communication with this field-receptive holographic workspace, seen as associated with but not
reducible to the human brain. The related brain supervening role of the event horizon workspace requires the
collective conscious and unconscious states and realizes a total holographic modality of consciousness that enables
effective predictive coding. This 5D, scale invariant, memory workspace, therefore, can be instrumental in the
manifestation of Psi phenomena and experiences of cosmic consciousness. At the sub-atomic level, gravity guided
quantum tunnelling and coherence of micro-tubular oscillations may produce neuronal entanglement. The latter
represents a dominant factor in long distance neural information transfer and functional brain binding. The
resulting synchronization of neural network frequencies is likely reflected in the abovementioned brain coherency
of EEG peaks, as well as in various mental states that promote feelings of mental wholeness in meditation and
psycho-mimetic drug therapy.

Introduction
The first aim of this study was to test the hypothesis whether spiatio-temporal Eigenmodes of EEG recordings can
be interpreted as to their degree of coherence as given by our previously developed algorithm for a general
acoustic quantum code of resonant coherence in nature. The latter was achieved by meta-analysis of available
literature dealing with EEG monitoring in healthy and diseased individuals and categorizing the recorded EEG wave
peaks as to their position on our coherence/decoherence scale. A further aim was to find indications for potential
measures to improve electromagnetic properties of cellular networks in our brain, by making use of external nonthermal electromagnetic coherent waves. This, in order to bring the participating brain cells in more coherent
healthier conditions. Therefore, our quantum code principle was applied in the context of electromagnetic brain
signals, employing the derived equation of quantum coherence: En = ħ ωref 2q 3m. The latter was also called the
Generalized Music Scale (GM-scale) by Meijer, the Geometric Musical Language (GML) by Bandyopadhyay, or the
General Music Code by Wong et al. Collectively, this is based on the concept a universal electromagnetic pattern in
nature that exhibits either discrete coherent (regulated)frequency bands or discrete decoherent (deregulated)
wave characteristics in the framework of harmonics.

This concept can be considered as a next step in the idea of Schrödinger (1944), that there exists a molecular
code-script, which supplies information to realize biological order in life cells. The proposed quantum wave
frequency value of coherence can be analytically calculated by the normalisation of each frequency value reported
in literature according to (semi-)harmonic principles by dividing or multiplying these values by the factor 2 N, , with N
as integer. We have earlier shown that this principle is in line by the known system of Chern numbers, that are
2

positioned at 13 basic elements of the proposed quantum wave equation of coherence and can be calculated by
partial flag manifolds Fn. Chern numbers are the determinants of the quantum metric and topological (toroidal)
invariants or called scalars and have been calculated in the period of 1950-2022. (Geesink, 2022; Meijer et al.,
2022). The proposed equation of coherence thus, can also be geometrically defined using energy trajectories on
nested torii.
Models for Interpreting Recorded EEG-patterns
The brain has billions of neurons, and each individual neuron connects (on average) to thousands of others.
Communication happens between them through small electrical currents that travel along the neurons and
throughout enormous networks of brain circuits. When all these neurons are activated they produce electrical
pulses – visualize a wave rippling through the crowd at a sports arena – this synchronized electrical activity results
in a “brainwave”. When many neurons interact in this way at the same time, this activity is strong enough to be
detected even outside the brain. By placing electrodes on the scalp, this activity can be amplified, analyzed, and
visualized. This is electroencephalography, means an electric brain graph. (Encephalon, the brain, is derived from
the ancient Greek “enképhalos,” meaning within the head.)
One way that EEG ‘brainwaves’ convey information is in their rate of repetition. Some oscillations, measured on the
scalp, occur at more than 30 cycles per second (and up to 100 cycles per second!) These cycles, also called
frequencies, are measured as Hz, or hertz, after the scientist who proved the existence of electromagnetic waves.
When looked at this way, brainwaves come in five flavors, (Fig.1), each of which corresponds to a Greek letter. As
we’ll see, these different brainwaves correspond to different states of thought or experience. While there are many
other ways to analyze brainwaves, many practitioners of a field called neurofeedback rely on dividing brain
oscillations into these five categories.
Some of these brain oscillations are more easily detectable on specific parts of the scalp, corresponding to the parts
of the brain just below. The brain has many specialized regions that correspond to different processes, thoughts,
and sensations. Particular oscillations often reflect distinct regions and networks in the brain communicating with
each other. Different patterns of brainwaves can be recognized by their amplitudes and frequencies. Brainwaves
can then be categorized, based on their level of activity or frequency. It’s important to remember, though, that
brainwaves are not the source or the cause of brain states, they’re just some of the detectable reflections of the
complex processes in the brain that produce our experience of being, thinking, and perceiving.
In the following, the different models used to describe our brain waves will be shortly discussed. The Nunez model
for the generation of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has been described as a neural field model on a sphere
with space-dependent delays. Dynamical realisations of this model either as a damped wave equation or an
integral-differential equation, have typically been studied in idealised one-dimensional or planar settings (Nunez,
1995, 2006, 2018). The original Nunez model has been revisited to specifically address the role of spherical
topology on spatio-temporal pattern generation. A mixture of Turing instability analysis has been used including
symmetric bifurcation theory, centre manifold reduction and direct simulations with a numerical scheme. Standing
and travelling wave solutions have been examined using calculation of primary and secondary bifurcations from a
steady state.
A so called bi-spectrum analysis detects nonlinear interactions, as an analytical tool in understanding neural
process underlying human EEG patterns and eigenstates; however, it does not quantify the coupling strength
(Pradhan, 2012). Linear stochastic models and spectral estimates are the most common methods for the analysis of
3

EEG because of their robustness, simplicity of interpretation, and show an approaching association with rhythmic
behavioral patterns of EEG’s and MEG’s. Higher order spectra have been proposed to indicate the hidden
characteristics of EEG signals. It was concluded that a collective behaviour of resonant synchronization exists and
the ability to retrieve information from brain memory proposed based on this mechanism. The input signals at
different driving frequencies, which are used to show different neural stimuli, can drive the coupled oscillators into
different synchronized groups locked to same effective frequencies and recover synchronized patterns emerged
from their collective dynamics (Zhang et al., 2018).

Figure 2a: An example of brain frequency modes for structural connectivity of gray and white matter in brain, called
the connectome (from Meijer et al, 2020, as modified from Atasoy et al.,2018).
Eigen-values depend more precise on a finer-scale cortical structure, implying that the Eigen-frequencies and
consequent dynamical properties of functional connectivity depend more strongly on details of individual cortical
folding, whereas eigenmodes are found to closely resemble spherical harmonics (Visser et al., 2017; Gabay and
Robinson, 2017). As a next step of developments, combinations of spatial and spectral structure was also found.
The spatial and spectral structure of oscillatory networks in the brain provide a readout of the underlying neuronal
function (Quinn, 2020). This method describes simultaneously a spectral and spatial network structure without
assumptions about either the notion of aspect how to stabilise this network and not a variability both within and
between subjects could be found.
It has also been proposed by Volk et al. 2018, that perceptual, motor and cognitive processes are based on
interactions between remote regions in the human brain. Neuronal populations show a phase synchronization
between different frequency ranges. A method has been proposed for the robust extraction of cross-frequency
phase-to-phase synchronized components related to EEG/MEG recordings. Generalized Cross-Frequency
Decomposition (GCFD) reconstructs the time courses of synchronized neuronal components, their spatial filters and
patterns. An algorithm was chosen to demonstrates cross-frequency phase synchrony in human brain E/MEG based
upon a harmonic model: recordings: p : q = 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, 2 : 1, 2 : 3, 3 : 1, 3 : 2, 3 : 4, 4 : 1, 4 : 3. The method has
4

been validated in simulations and tested it with real EEG recordings including resting state data and steady state
visually evoked potentials (SSVEP). In EEG experiments a modest correlation could be found between pattern
similarity and the strength of cross-frequency phase synchrony (Volk et al. 2018).See further discussion on page 43.
The low-frequency range is the fundamental frequency of the brain, on which the functioning of all its elemen ets
and their synchronization depends. Low frequencies of our brain are the synchronizing basic rhythm pulse
(baseline) of the entire system ensemble. Melodies and harmonies of oscillations of different elements of the
system synchronize with it. The mind works in a continuous mode of transducing signals, from a continuous wave
into a discrete code and back into continuous representations of these signals (Tregub, 2021). Neuronal
communication is subserved by neuronal synchronization, that can be quantified by the coherence metric and has
been named “Communication Through Coherence” (CTC). An essential proposition of the CTC hypothesis is that an
activated neuronal group tends to engage in rhythmic synchronization, and several rhythms and their interplay
render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective (Fries, 2005, 2009, 2015).
The various models described here, assume a harmonic-like distribution of frequencies (Fig. 2a), and make use of a
synchronization principle, but the precise positions of the particular frequencies were not earlier defined. In the
present paper it is proposed that all healthy brain frequencies have discrete semi-harmonic values, whereas
unhealthy brain frequencies are positioned just in between the healthy frequency positions. The reason for this
principle is based on our earlier findings that EMF frequencies of healthy cells and related bio- molecules behave
according to a quantum model earlier described by Fröhlich, 1968. The here applied quantum model is in fact a
further precision of the model of Fröhlich . Fröhlich proposed a theory of coherent excitations present in living cells
and cellular domains, that attains a state of a so called Fröhlich-Bose-Einstein condensate at room temperature.
Since fluctuations of matter are supposed to be related to fluctuations of the electromagnetic field (EMF) and vice
versa. In this framework, life conditions are represented by a non-linear non-local system, which is governed by
reduction of entropy, called neg-entropy. A driven set of molecular oscillators can condense with nearly all the
supplied energy activating the vibrational mode at the lowest frequency.
The present extension of the Fröhlich model is proposed by us based on a meta-analysis of about 1200 data of
living cells/molecules (see Geesink and Meijer, 2016; Meijer and Geesink, 2016). It is conceived as biophysical
entangled quantum process: conformational states of living cells/molecules show typical spatial arrangements of
atoms, that are characteristic for building homeostasis, but also guide programmed processes of decay and
apoptosis. In quantum physics non-interchangeable observables such as location can be related to a wave function
in the complex number space. In this concept of space, all living cells/molecules involved, show concerted wave
frequency, that can be modelled as energy positions at a toroidal geometric space, that accommodates the
particular energy flow as trajectories on a nested torus and can be described mathematically by quantum wave
equation of coherence (regulation) or decoherence (deregulation, Geesink and Meijer, 2018 a; c). Of note, this
model is based on a concept of nature, that makes use of a spatial and spectral structure consisting of a discrete
coupled network of frequencies, but, importantly, is closely intertwined with a destabilising network, that makes
use of decoherent or chaotic frequencies. Such a bi-modal system that couples coherent and decoherent activity in
a network of frequencies was also found in quantum biology, such as in the process of photosynthesis (see reviews
treated in Meijer et al., 2020). Here, wave superposition, tunnelling and non-local entanglement play a role
(Geesink and Meijer, 2018 b). Interestingly, this network is best described by a semi- harmonic distribution, rather
than by a purely harmonic distribution (see next section 1), and its geometry is not accommodated by a sphere
but rather by torus geometry with a nested structure (Meijer et al 2020, Meijer and Geesink, 2017, see also Fig. 7)

1. Methodological Aspects and Explanation of the Algorithm
The analyzed collective data as depicted in Table.2, are extracted from current literature, using the generally
known and broadly used method of meta-analysis of available, mostly peer reviewed, studies. An often raised,
potential problem of such pattern recognition analysis, is a possible selection bias , an item that is fully relevant and
understandable in itself. This may involve either selection in included literature or in the scientific data of each
individual paper. We want to emphasize, therefore, that from the initiation of our studies in 2014, we provided
complete reference lists of the analysed studies so that the interested reader can fully check its completeness as
well as our registration of the frequency data in the individual published reports and in that manner can objectively
control the inferred EMF distribution patterns. Also the data-base with a complete overview of the scientific
material in the present brain-EEG study can be found on Internet at the ResearchGate site, (Geesink, 2022b). We

are confident, therefore, that our meta-analyses data are a reliable and faithful representation of the
literature involved (see also the statistical treatment by Sonderkamp et al., 2019).

We framed our EMF frequency scale as semi-harmonic since it represents a generally known tone distribution in
music theory on the basis of 12-tone descending Pythagorean mathematics, in which the harmonic relations of 2:1
and 2:3 are fitted into a scale of 12, and in music theory is called a semi-harmonic scale. Since such a fit always
generates a small error (called comma), the scale is tempered in music theory in various ways, in order to obtain a
more perfect fit. Some other attempts to achieve this goal, are listed in the Table 1 , above (from Geesink and
Meijer, 2018a). ). The proposed principle is based on coherent semi-harmonic eigenfrequencies (50% is exactly
harmonic, the other frequencies show a mean but small deviation of about 1.20% from the harmonic values.
It is clear that, at first sight, there are only relatively modest differences, that in fact, do not clearly favour any
particular method of tempering, that is, for the present purpose of categorizing EEG frequencies as coherent or
decoherent. This is so, since the decoherent frequency values are numerically quite different from the coherent
ones, (since they are defined as lying exactly between two adherent coherent values, see equations on page 8
Yet, for detailed application for processes in physics, the semi-harmonic scale should pobably be preferred (see for
example the discussion on page 43).Yet, these small differences will not affect the reliability of the
coherence/decoherence categorization in the analyzed EEG recordings.

6

Apart from the harmonic scale, there is another, often mentioned, physical scale: the Fibonacci series of numbers
related to the Golden Mean / Ratio Phi (1.61803398875). In the Fibonacci scale we find the first 12 numbers:
0.9; 0.9; 1.8; 2.7; 4.5; 7.2; 11.7; 18.9; 30.6; 49.5; 129.6, the closest Harmonic values to Phi are:
0.9; 0.9; 1.8; 2.7; 4.5; 7.2; 14.4; 18.9; 28.8; 48.6; 129.6.
Are these numerologies somehow related? In fact, eight Phi frequencies fit with the harmonic ones whereas 3 (fat
numbers), do not, representing the so called gap numbers. Yet, in the Fibonacci series the harmonic relations are
hidden! if we take into account the differences of the fat Phi numbers with the harmonic ones for instance 14.4 –
11.7= 2.7, a value that is present in the harmonic series, while the differences of 28.8 and 48.6 differ 1.8 and 0.9,
also present in the harmonic series. In a more systematic approach Chen and Kennedy 2012, showed their
mathematical relation in grouping harmonic series into Fibonacci lengths blocks. Thus, also the numerology and
their backgrounds are different, the two series meet in a mathematical but also functional context. As we will see in
section 8.2, both series play a crucial role in defining EEG patterns and describe the brain in its resting (Phi) and
active (harmomic) condition respectively, resulting in the standing waves of the EEG bands, that are uncoupled by
golden mean tone separation. In exactly the same way simple wave ratios were used to create the octave musical
scale- by close approximation. Dan Winter wrote us recently: your 1.0535 is almost 20/19 being 1.0526, while
1.125 = 9/8, and 1.1852 is about 1 and 3/16: 1.1875, 1.2656 = 1 and 17/64, 1.333 = 4/3, 1.414 = root 2 > definition
of octave scaling 1.5 = 3/2, 1.5803 about 1 and 29/50: 1.58, and 1.685 = 1 plus 11/16.

Figure 2 b: Pascal Triangle on the relation of Harmonics and Fibonacci numbers
The intimate, interwoven relation between harmonic relations and the Fibonacci number series (Fig. 2b), can also
be demonstrated in a Pascal triangle, with harmonic series in black numbers at the left and diagonally derived
Fibonacci coloured numbers at the arrows at the right (taken from Resonance Science blog, dynamic topological
phase driven by a Fibonacci pulse). The 12 harmonic quantum code values mentioned above are situated in the
figure in the left number row between the values 1 an 2, and can be considered as sub-harmonic oscillations or
overtones. The broad representation of Fibonacci patterns and Golden ratio in Nature and Biology as well as in

7

Physics, Astrophysics and Chemistry was reviewed by Pletser, 2017, showing this well recognized phenomenon in
science as a connecting principle that may underlie the construction of life and the cosmos (Table 2).

Table 2: Fibonacci Geometry reported in Various Disciplines in Science
Of note, the Acoustic Quantum Code frequencies are also, for a large part, compatible with the acoustic spectrum
of the CMB (Meijer, 2022). In this framework they can also be envisioned as stemming from a primordial quantum
space-time manifold that at, or prior to, the supposed Big Bang was orchestrated with similar acoustic frequencies.
These may, after symmetry breaking, have played a role in the creation of matter in a sequential number of 88
temperature steps (as known from current physics and cosmology, and including the Higgs mechanism). These
were shown by us to be fully compatible with the involvement of the quantum code as revealed in our studies (see
the book of Chow et al., 2022, and Meijer and Wong, 2021, 2022). Here, at the birth of our universe, the term
semi-harmonic and the other tempered scales can obviously not be used because of the primordial character
implies billions of years separated from the music theory of our own historical era. In this case we should be
content with the container term harmonic, as done in present physics and cosmology, in general.
It should also be realized, that we should not only pay attention to the individual discrete wave frequencies, but
rather to interference of multiple frequencies (tones in music theory), that together generate musical cords (Fig.7),
and whole symphonies and through matrix-like tone interactions can even produce torus-like geometric patterns
(see Meijer and Geesink, 2022). One example of the latter is the so-called Tonnetz torus (Meijer and Geesink,
2016).

2. The Bio-physical Acoustic Quantum Code Model of Resonant Coherence
A cornerstone of the proposed brain model is an extensive meta-analysis of now about 1200 articles reported from
1950 to 2021 in literature (see Fig.3, below), dealing with endogenously measured and/or exogenously applied
electromagnetic field frequencies in tissues, cells and bio-molecules. It was inferred that all of the distributed
coherent and decoherent energies can be scaled by ratios of 1:2, or 2:3 and close approaches thereof and make
use of 12 basic eigenmodes, representing the core of a much larger self-similar (fractal) range in the sub-Hertz till
Peta Hertz region (Geesink and Meijer, 2014; Geesink, 2018a). The overall analysis showed a consistent band-like
pattern of alternating beneficial (stabilizing) and detrimental (destabilizing) EMF frequencies (see Fig.3, below), and
the band separation was shown to be statistically significant (Sonderkamp et al., 2018).

Figure 3a. Measured/applied frequency data of living cells systems that are compatible with life conditions, or
health-sustaining or health improving (coherent data and zones: green) and measured/applied frequency data of
living cells systems that are detrimental for health (decoherent data: red) versus calculated normalized frequencies.
Biological effects measured following exposures or endogenous effects of living cells in vitro and in vivo at
frequencies in the bands of Hz, kHz, MHz, GHz, THz, PHz. Green triangles plotted on a logarithmic x-axis represent
calculated normalized (Hz) health-sustaining frequencies; red triangles represent calculated health-destabilizing
frequencies. Each point indicated in the graph is taken from published biological data and are a typical frequency for
a biological experiment(s). For clarity, points are randomly distributed along the Y-axis; Yellow lines are transition
frequencies (Geesink, 2022 a).
The complete range of EM frequencies (lying between 0.2 Hz to 500 THz, see (Geesink and Meijer, 2016), on basis
of the 12 core frequencies, is depicted in Fig. 2, see for a statistical analysis and validation of the frequency pattern
the paper of Sonderkamp et al. 2019. The depicted pattern of alternating frequency bands in Fig.3a, here ranging
from 249 to 486 Hz, represents only a part of a much more extended fractal pattern of which the adjacent windows
to the left (up to 1.0 Hz) can be found by multiple divisions by 2 (2 n) and to the right up to the THz range (up to 500
THz) by multiplications by 2, (2n). For example the value of 1Hz in the overall scale can be derived from the initial
7

coherent value on the scale below of 256 being 2 .

9

This striking pattern of the experimentally chosen electromagnetic fields within in a large variety of vitro and in vivo
life systems, thus, revealed not only a pattern of stabilizing (coherent) EMF frequencies, but also destabilizing and
unhealthy biological effects that could consequently be described by two different quantum equations:
𝐸𝑛 =

𝑞
𝑘=1

𝛼𝑘 ħ 𝜔𝑟𝑒𝑓 2𝑛+𝑝 3𝑚

Secondly, a quantum equation of a decoherent (disentangled) distribution of energy:
log 𝐷𝑚 (𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑜 ℎ.𝑛) =

log 𝐹𝑚 𝑐𝑜ℎ.𝑛 + log 𝐹𝑚 𝑐𝑜ℎ.𝑛+1

number of octave frequency series of 12, in a fractal setting, its maximal value q is not yet established. In our studies
up to 60 adjacent series were identified in a range of Hz to GHz.
The stabilising and destabilising electromagnetic field effects, were observed in a wide window of health conditions
and related disorders and hopefully can be applied in the design of therapeutic measures in the near future. The
patterned arrangements of EMF frequencies can be described by electromagnetic wave patterns positioned on an
acoustic or “tone-scale”, based on an underlying quantum wave equation. The proposed equation shows a discrete
distribution of energy: En= ħ ωref 2q 3m, that implies the aspect of semi-harmonic features. The latter may find a
physical background in quantum non-locality, entanglement and tunnelling and is in line with the earlier published
models of Davydov and Fröhlich (Geesink, 2017a, 2017b, 2018 a, b, c).
In conclusion: The overall results show the presence of a molecular code-script, which supplies information to
realize biological order in life cells and substantiates collective Bose-Einstein type of coherent wave behaviour.
Since living cells are always embedded in the existing force fields in nature a guiding role of zero-point energy was
proposed(Meijer et al, 2022, Keppler,2022). The coherent and decoherent (chaos-like) frequencies can be aligned
at a frequency scale and are arranged according to an alternating ordering positioned at a toroidal geometry, while
transition frequencies are located just in between the coherent and decoherent frequency zones (Geesink, 2018a).
This special arrangement of energies can als be described as integral trajectories displayed in torus-geometry as
also have also been shown by acoustic (tone-scale) theories that fits in a fractal information theory and can be
approached by a toroidal model (Meijer and Geesink, 2018a, Meijer et al., 2022), and see Fig. 3.

3. The Quantum Code of Coherence as Applied to Brain Waves
Mathematical Neuroscience is a tool for mathematical biologists seeking to discover the complexities of brain
dynamics in an integrative way. It is a research discipline devoted to the theory and methods of nonlinear analysis
of infinite systems based on functional analysis techniques applied in mathematics. Neural models that describe
the spatio-temporal evolution of coarse-grained variables-such as synaptic or firing rate activity in populations of
neurons, often take the form of integral-differential equations would not normally reflect an integrative approach
(Brzychczy and Poznanski, 2013). Quantum mechanics plays a role in the theory of consciousness/mind; ultimately
there is no “mind” that can be separated from “matter” and no “matter” that can be separated from “mind”.

10

The brain as a mixed physical system composed of the macroscopic neuronal system and an additional microscopic
system. The former consists of pathway conduction of neural impulses. The latter is assumed to be a quantum
mechanical many‐body system interacting with the macroscopic neuron system (Tarlaci, 2010). Quantum
information state spaces can be considered as extensions of classical information spaces, corresponding to neural
codes. A key point is that processing of information by the brain involves superposition of such states (Khrennikov,
2018). A conscious electromagnetic information field theory has been proposed that consciousness is physically
integrated, and causally active, through information encoded in the brain’s global electromagnetic (EM) field and is
related to implemented algorithms in space, rather than time, within the brain’s EM field (Mc Fadden, 2020).
Bohm stated that consciousness and our brain are not only present in animate life forms but also in typical
inanimate matter since, energy, space, time and consciousness are not separate aspects. Schrodinger, who initiated
quantum mechanics, postulated that ‘LIFE’ is also a quantum phenomenon (Bohm, 1952, Schrödinger, 1944;
Kauffman, 2020). A molecular code-script has been proposed by Meijer and Geesink, 2016; 2019, which supplies
information to realize biological order in life cells.
Information can be processed at the quantum level orders of magnitude more rapidly than it can be processed
classically, and discrete systems make use of phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and tunnelling to
enhance their performance (Meijer and Raggett, 2014; Davies, 2005). Brain function requires complementary
information processing mechanisms both at iso-energetic and quantum levels, enabling bottom up and top-down
information processing, which requires a nested organization of fine-tuned neural micro-sites that enable
coherence/de-coherence transitions as a basis for information transfer (Meijer, 2014). It is well-known that water
plays a necessary and key role, and a frequency spectra formula for biomolecules has been derived, starting with
water, that are represented by a toroidal structure, such that other elements essential to life, such as oxygen,
carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen can all be fitted into the same formula, dividing it into coherent and de-coherent
states (Wong, 2019, 2020; Geesink, 2020a; Geesink and Meijer, 2018b, Meijer and Wong, 2021, 2022).
In all of these processes coherence plays an important role. Quantum coherence is related to entanglement, and
gets dispersed in the whole universe. Through interaction with other physical systems, coherence is effectively
converted to decoherence (Sabbadini, 2021). Our hypothesis is that the human brain and related processes that
generate consciousness are permanently exposed to typical coherent and decoherent electromagnetic fields in the
form of discrete electromagnetic waves (Meijer, 2014a, 2014b; Meijer and Geesink, 2017, 2019b, 2020). It was
postulated by us that consciousness in the whole universe, arises through scale invariant, and nested toroidal
coupling of various energy fields. In the brain of the human species, this takes the form of a proposed holographic
workspace, that collects active information in a ”brain event horizon”, representing an internal and fully integral
model of the self. This brain-supervening workspace is equipped to convert integrated coherent and decoherent
wave energies into attractor type/standing waves, employing soliton and photon resonances that guide the related
cortical template to a higher coordination of reflection and action as well as network synchronicity, as required for
conscious states. Electromagnetically seen, living organisms make use of typical natural quantum resonances, that
can be described by equations for standing waves: En = ħ ωref 2q 3m.
Memory states are constructed through the condensation in the lowest energy state of quanta associated to the
long-range correlations and it has been asked whether entanglements acts as a sort of cosmic imprint via the
vibratory field of zero-point energy (Pessa, 2014, Sabbadini, 2019, Vitiello, 2020). THe proposed theory of quantum
biophysics has shown that quantum coherent assembled waves exist for all living biomolecules and cells (Geesink,
2017a), EPR-experiments, super-conduction and also for zero-point energy (Geesink and Meijer, Geesink, 2018b,
2021 b). The postulate of an acting resonating energy field can be further substantiated by the fact that energies of
diatomic molecules have a significant term of the vibrational zero-point energy (ZPE) to correct the total energy of
11

the molecules (Irikura, 2005, 2007; Geesink, 2022). When the ZPE field is organized in nested tori, (by some
conceived as superfluid vortices), then this field can be described by the same eigenvalues of the proposed
quantum wave equation.
The discovery of warm temperature quantum vibrations in microtubules inside brain neurons by the research
group of Bandyopadhyay shows that EEG rhythms may be partly derived from deeper level microtubule vibrations
(Bandyopadhyay, 2013; Agrawal, 2017, 2018). It was earlier debated if, in the brain, quantum wave information
perse can become expressed, considering the supposed extremely short coherency times. Yet, tis is only true if
there is no efficient shielding from the environment (see discussion on this topic in Hameroff and Penrose (2012,
2014). Of note,, Sahu et al, (2013 a, b; 2014), demonstrated a spectrum of coherent vibration bands in isolated
micro-tubules and suggested this phenomenon as the very basis for information processing in neuronal systems.
Interestingly, it was also indicated that coherent quantum processing in the brain can also be realized in an
additional manner, since singlet state phosphorus spin states are remarkably resistant to de-coherence even in the
wet and warm conditions (Fisher, 2015).

3. Healthy and Unhealthy States in Brain Can be Described by the Acoustic Quantum
Code Equations of Coherence/ Decoherence
It is hypothesized that coherent and decoherent discrete states are positioned in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and
gamma regions of our brain waves (see Fig.1). As treated in section 2, it has been observed that life systems,
internally and externally exposed to non-thermal electromagnetic fields can, through resonance induce a high
extent of coherency in the cell and its biomolecules, showing frequency patterns that are fully in line with the
pointer states of the proposed quantum equation of coherence (Geesink, 2018d). The transitions of healthy
(coherent) to unhealthy (decoherent) conformations of the exposed bio-molecules in cells can be understood by
assuming a combined change of intensities of the wave spectra and/or detrimental shifts of frequencies. The typical
changes involved have been attributed to transition of coherent states to states that are less coherent or even
exhibit clearly decoherent modes. In such cases the imposed frequencies induce less order or even complete
disorder (Geesink, 2018a). A partial composition of coherent and decoherent patterns can regarded as unhealthy
or even as a diseased state and, especially, a predominantly decoherent frequency pattern can be regarded as a
sign for decomposition of bio-molecular order that can also be interpreted as programmed cell death.

3.1 Monitoring EEG patterns in Mental Disorders
The following studies concerning measured frequencies of brain waves related unhealthy states can be described
by the second quantum wave equation of decoherence: Fingelkurts et al. (2006, 2020), Demanuele et al. (2007),
Deiber et al. (2020), Acharya et al. (2015), Colombo et al. (2019), Hinrikus et al. (2010), Yuezhi Li et al. (2017),
Secco et al. (2020), Schulman et al., (2011), Ros et al., (2014), Dvey-Aharon et al. (2015), Allen and Cohen (2010).
The following studies related unhealthy states and electromagnetic waves of brain waves, neurons, microtubules
and glands also fit in the proposed algorithm of decoherence, among others: Bawin et al. (1973); Sanders et al.
(1980); Maskey et al. (2011; 2014); Hao D. (2012); Oscar and Hawkins (1977); Schirmacher et al. (1999); Son Y.
(2015); Lee HJ et al. (2011); Sahin et al. (2016); Kesari K.K. 2014); Alkis et al. (2019); Ibitayo A.O. (2017); Megha et
al. (2015); Varghese et al. (2018); Ghazizadeh, V. and M. Naziroglu (2014); Obajuluwa A. O. (2004); Delen K.
(2021); Gandhi C. R. (1989); Pu et al. (1997); Sharma A. (2014); Pikov V. (2011); Romanenko S. (2011); Sheng Zhi
Tan (2019); Ol'shevskaia et al. (2009), see for further examples the database of Geesink, 2022b).
12

The analysis of 60 different studies of brain frequencies and 120 different frequencies related to brain
measurements, brain stimulation, rTMS applications, and neurons in vitro learns that all the measured frequencies
and frequency patterns, can be precisely positioned at the proposed spectral modes of eigenstates, coherent and
decoherent, as described by the proposed quantum equations, see Table 1, (healthy brain waves in green,
unhealthy brain frequencies in red) and see also in the database of Geesink, 2022b, on ResearchGate.

4.2 EMF frequencies in brain tissues/slices , isolated cultured neurons and brain glands
A preliminary meta-analysis study have been performed by us related to influences of internal and external
electromagnetic waves of brain slices, brain tissues in culture, microtubules, glands, and DNA that fit in the
proposed algorithm of coherence, that show healthy conditions (regulating): see for further examples in our
database paper, Geesink , 2022b). In addition, we analysed unhealthy conditions (deregulating) in vitro, under the
influences of internal and external electromagnetic waves of brain tissues in culture, brain slices, brain glands, and
DNA in multiple studies that can found by the reader on ResearchGate.
Results: A similar frequency pattern of coherent and decoherent frequencies was found in, in vitro, brain
preparations such as tissues in culture, brain slices and glands. It was possible to identify electromagnetic wave
activity frequencies in these preparations and thereby identifying EMF frequencies likely related to the brain waves
in intact brain. These consistently showed EMF frequency values according to the proposed algorithm of
frequencies (Fig.3a and 3b).

We show here that the coherent and decoherent (chaos-like) frequencies can be aligned at a frequency scale also
for the different studied brain tissues and that the particular frequencies again are arranged according to an
alternating coherence/de-coherence ordering, while transition frequencies are located just in between the
coherent and decoherent frequencies (Geesink, 2018a), see Fig. 3 a, b. This arrangement of energies can be
described as integral trajectories displayed on a torus -like geometry and calculated by the abovementioned a
quantum equation of coherence and of decoherence, respectively (Geesink, 2022a, see also section 2). In
conclusion: brain tissue studied in vitro are also embedded in an integral cellular context, exhibiting, beside the
known genomic and proteomic modalities, well-defined electromagnetic frequency patterns (Geesink, 2020c), see
appendices 1 and 2 in the published database of Geesink on ResearchGate(Geesink, 2022b).

4.3 Coherency Analysis of EEG-recordings in Health and Mental Disorders
Analyses of about 60 different studies of the current literature with regard to brain frequencies, recorded after
brain stimulation and rTMS applications, learns that almost all the measured and/or applied of about 120 analysed
frequencies of the frequency patterns can be positioned in the proposed spectral modes of quantum code
eigenstates, including the positioning of coherent and decoherent states, as described by the proposed quantum
equations and the studies mentioned in section 2.
The model of spatio-spectral eigenmode brain waves as related to both healthy states, that are coherent, or to
unhealthy states, called decoherent and could be substantiated by analysing the measured frequency patterns of
EEG’s and MEG’s, measured by: 1) Van Albada et al. (2013), 2) Quinn et al. (2020), 3) Demanuele et al. (2007,
2012), 4) Python package investigations about EEG, 5) Wei He et al. (2019), 6) Hinrikus et al. (2005), 7) BenSimon et al. (2008), 8) FieldTrip toolbox (2020), 9) Makeig et al. 2002, 10) Drijvers, 2020, and see for further
examples the database paper on ResearchGate.

Table 3: A: Coherent EEG- peak frequencies( expressed in % of total recorded peak, estimated by comparison with
the eigen-values of our quantum code algorithm, as reported in Whole Brain in healthy conditions and in Brains of
patients with various mental disorders. Note that the number of analyzed studies indicated by n, may imply
multiple patients in which EEG patterns were recorded that each can consist of various EEG tracks through multi14

channel recording. B: Coherent EEG-frequencies from various (in parenthesis) studies (depicted in blue), as related

The different data of brain waves of coherent (regulating) frequency positions have been depicted in Table 3, and
coherent (regulating) as well brain waves of decoherent (deregulating) frequency are shown in Fig. 4, in which
frequency data of living cell systems were reported that are life-sustaining (green points) and detrimental for life
(in red squares) versus calculated normalized frequencies, and the microtubular frequencies are superposed.
The studied examples of unhealthy brain states in psychiatry exhibited a clear relation with less coherent, and thus
an increasing decoherent behaviour: Schizophrenia patients exhibited a phase synchronization deficiency, as
compared to a normal control group, especially for the first stimulus, in the 2-12 Hz frequency range. This
deficiency explains the lower amplitudes and may be a significant factor contributing to reduced sensory gating
reported in schizophrenic subjects (Jansen et al. 2003). A nonlinear nature of phase coupling enables rich and
context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, playing an important role in brain dysfunction
such as Epileptic disorders. Numerous phase synchronization measurements have been developed for seizure
detection and prediction (Wang et al. 2019).

Nonlinear dynamics can arise in large networks of excitable elements in response to excess of noise: at low noise,
solutions remain in the vicinity of the resting state and large-noise solutions show asynchronous activity, while the
network displays orderly, perfectly synchronized periodic responses at intermediate levels of noise. This
observation provided a potential insight with regard to the efficiency of high-frequency stimulation therapies,
known as deep brain stimulation such as in Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by an
increased synchronization of brain motor circuits (Touboul et al. 2020).
EEG monitoring in Alzheimer's disease showed a significant decrease of coherence in the alpha band in temporoparieto-occipital areas (Locatelli et al., 1998). A depressed and non-depressed group showed typical different
coherence values. According to global coherence (ranging between the extremes of 0.0 and 1.0), it was found that
the degree of coherence in the non-depressed group was 0.3150, which is significantly higher than that of the
mildly depressed group, whose coherence was 0.2669 in the high gamma band. It was found that the normal group
had a significantly higher clustering coefficient in the frontal region and the parietal region than the depressed
group (Li, 2017).
Inter-areal coherence has been hypothesized, to be explained by the fact that outputs from one cortical area give
rise to synaptic inputs in the same brain area and correlated synaptic inputs in another area. A mathematical
analysis demonstrated that coherence between a sending and receiving area is precisely predicted from two
parameters: Inter-areal connectivity and oscillatory synchronization in the sending area. The model predicts
narrow-band coherence even in case of a flat transfer function and in the absence of spiking entrainment in a
downstream area and reproduces frequency-specific Granger-causality patterns between brain areas. In general,
Granger-causality occurs between field potentials and is dominated by oscillatory synchronization in the sending
area, whereas spiking entrainment is determined by the resonant properties of the receiver (Schneider, 2020).
A method for data-driven visualization of multichannel EEG coherence networks has been proposed and allows an
analysis of the functional connectivity within and between brain regions, which could be used to explore the
relationship between functional connectivity and underlying brain structures. A dyslectic group showed increased
slow activity (Delta and Theta) in the frontal and right temporal regions of the brain, whereas EEG coherence was
increased in the frontal, central and temporal regions for all frequency bands. There was a symmetric increase in
coherence for the lower frequency bands (Delta and Theta) and a specific right-temporo-central increase in
coherence for the higher alpha and beta frequency bands (Arns, 2007, 2014). Different bands were analysed with
respect to coherence, in which the authors find that, during an emotional face presentation task, only gamma wave
coherence could differentiate between depressed and healthy subjects. Mildly depressed patients show lower
gamma coherence only at the right hemisphere, no significant difference was found for the left side of the brain.
Also using coherence, Andrew and Alexander Fingelkurts, (2017), presented a work relating three brain operational
modules to self-consciousness. Hyper-synchrony in all three modules that are related to depressive symptoms,
contribute to excessive self-focus, rumination, and body tension (Li et al. 2016, 2017).
Brain activity consists of a limited repertoire of local EEG states and the size of the state repertoires was associated
with changes in cognition and vigilance or neuro-psychopathologic conditions. It was demonstrated also that EEG
oscillations which constituted EEG states were characteristic for different groups of conditions in accordance with
the oscillations’ functional significance. The results suggested that (a) there is a limit in the number of local states
available to the cortex and many ways in which these local states can rearrange themselves and still produce the
same global state and (b) EEG individuality is determined by varying proportions of universal, optional and unique
16

oscillatory states. It has been proposed that EEG oscillations that determine EEG oscillatory states are characteristic
for different groups of conditions according to functional significance of these EEG oscillations (Fingelkurts, 2013,
2014).

5. EEG Microstates after Electromagnetic Stimulation of Brain
One of the aims of this paper is to find further clues for improve electromagnetic treatments of cellular networks
in our brain by making use of non-thermal electromagnetic waves to bring living cells in a healthier situation.

5.1 Technologies to Monitor Brain function
In recent years, EEG-microstate analysis has gained popularity as a tool to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics of
large-scale electrophysiology data. It has been used in a wide range of EEG studies and the discovered microstates
have been linked to cognitive function and brain diseases and researchers have proposed that these microstates
represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes. Several studies have
further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric
conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and
EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks
as identified using fMRI (Michel, 2018). An analysis of rate of change of trajectory in sensor space suggests gradual
microstate transitions as opposed to the classical binary view of EEG microstates (Mishra, 2020).
Mathematical Neuroscience is a tool for mathematical biologists seeking to discover the complexities of brain
dynamics in an integrative way. It is a research monograph devoted to the theory and methods of nonlinear
analysis of infinite systems based on functional analysis techniques arising in modern mathematics. Neural models
that describe the spatio-temporal evolution of coarse-grained variables-such as synaptic or firing rate activity in
populations of neurons-and often take the form of integral-differential equations but would not normally reflect an
integrative approach (Mishra, 2020).
Multiscale modelling techniques have attracted increasing attention by philosophers of science, but the resulting
discussions have almost exclusively focused on issues surrounding explanation (e.g., reduction and emergence). It
has been argued that besides explanation, multi-scale techniques can serve important exploratory functions, but
the organisation at different scales is ill understood. (Haueis, 2022).

5.2 EEG - Patterns after Repetitive Transcranial Electromagnetic Stimulations in Neuropathic Disorders
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been reported to modify brain oscillations and the periodic
electromagnetic force generated during rTMS can result in local entrainment of biologically relevant rhythms,
mimicking frequency specific oscillatory activities triggered, for example, by cognitive tasks. Next to transcranial
alternating current stimulation (tACS), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is applied, that are effective at
modulating neural brain activity and results in behavioral effects in animals and human subjects (Antal, 2016).
Potential differential beneficial effects have been found at typical frequencies, among others mentioned by
Schutter (2009), Arns (2010), Torii (2012), Feffer (2018), Krepel (2020), Miron (2021), Meng (2021). For example:
the applied frequencies are positioned at: 0.75, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 25 Hz, are related to the found
antidepressant effects, and precisely fit with the proposed eigenstates (Eigen-frequencies) described by the
equation of coherence, see the blue letters, in Table 2, and in Fig. 5, as well as the many figures in the related
database (Geesink, 2022b).
In the light of these data, a potential biomarker could be proposed, that may eventually show diagnostic capability
to classify a measure of healthy and unhealthy behaviour by analysing the multi-scale patterns of brain waves
17

related to discrete frequencies and amplitudes. Discrete frequencies fit in a coherent or in a decoherent discrete
frequency quantum pattern and has been substantiated by a quantum physical model about phase-synchronisation
of the spectral lines of EEG (Electroencephalography) and MEG (Magnetoencephalography). Phase-synchronisation
while in the present study spatio-spectral Eigen-modes were shown by us in whole brain and brain tissues in vitro
and could be related to a discrete distribution of energy: En= ħ ωref 2q 3m.
In addition, we earlier performed a frequency analysis of low-laser transcranial therapy to improve cognitive
function and neurogenesis and also to combat neurological deficits, in which a frequency band range from 308 till
980 nm was used. We calculated the percentage distance between the applied frequencies in these studies and the
calculated coherent frequencies according to our proposed algorithm, and inferred that the data of Hamblins
group (see Vatansever and Hamblin, 2012), are positioned in the area of coherent frequencies.

approximation in terms of band powers, given by the areas of the gray bars (reference Van Albada, 2013) (coherent

For example: rTMS is applied at typical or nearby coherent frequencies at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 20, 25 Hz

6. Toroidal Geometry to Describe Life and Brain Activity in Health and Disease
In 1984, Starobinsky and Zel'dovich, at the Landau Institute in Moscow proposed a cosmological model where the
shape of the universe is a 3-torus. A phenomenological model of universe, in which, the universe was in a maximum
symmetrical quantum state before the beginning of the classical Friedman expansion, has been examined. The
spectrum of long-wave, background, gravitational radiation is calculated in this model (Starobinsky, 1979). It has
been proposed that a toroidal geometry status can be used as a fixed background space-time. A proposed
generalized model of toroidal organized quantum information (Fig.6), supports the notion that the current 2D
Standard Model and 2D modalities of String Theory could benefit from introducing 3D toroidal geometry and to
anchor both theories at a proposed quantum toroidal geometry of Chern numbers of invariant length (Geesink,
2021c, Meijer and Geesink, 2022).
A comprehensive model for the creation of the universe was recently described by Chow et al, 2022; Meijer and
Wong, 2020;2021, as a process of symmetry breaking from a primordial 5D homogeneous manifold to our 4D
Lorentz manifold, in which process toroidal geometry arises spontaneously and matter forms are created via the
Higgs mechanism. The latter process occurs in multiple steps that altogether represent the gradual cooling after the
so called Big Bang. The latter process was proposed by Chow et al., 2022 as being guided by a general music code
(GMC) that, according to the authors, exhibits the complete discrete frequency spectrum of the Acoustic Quantum
Code described above. Interestingly in this respect is a recently proposed concept showing that sound interference
of a series of tones within a musical cord, generates a toroidal pattern that resembles the known Tonnetz torus of
music( Meijer and Geesink, 2014). If the shape of our universe, indeed, is adequately described by toroidal
geometry (Fig.6 and 7, and the general music scale frequencies represent the supposed quantum fluctuations that
were assumed to have initiated the events lying at the basis of the cosmic creation process, it stands to reason that
both phenomena were also instrumental in the further evolution of inanimate and later animate structures, up to
the present and future life on our planet and beyond.

In this framework, coherence is an ideal property of waves that enables stationary (i.e. temporally and spatially
constant) interference. Coherence was originally conceived in connection with Thomas Young's double-slit
experiment in optics, but now is used in any field that involves interference of waves, such as acoustics, electrical
engineering, and quantum mechanics. Coherence has also been defined as the physical congruence of wave
properties within wave packets, and it is a property of stationary waves (i.e. temporally and spatially constant) that
enables a type of wave interference, known as constructive. The processes are called coherent when the variability
of the phase differences between the signals is relatively small, whereas the wave processes are defined as
incoherent, the phase difference has a high degree of variability.

indicates the combination of 3.1-Hz phase (dark gray) and 5.075-Hz phase (light gray) that yields peak performance.

The present study supports the notion that frequency patterns of bio-molecules in normal healthy cells are
precisely positioned at the coherent pointer state frequencies of the proposed quantum equation. In contrast, bio20

molecules present in diseased cells are positioned at typical decoherent frequency patterns. Based on these results
an integral biological model has been inferred that makes use of four types of attractors: a static fixed-point
frequency; a periodic repetition of sequences of twelve basic reference intervals; a periodic torus geometry, and a
chaos attractor positioned just in between coherent pointer states related to decoherence. Quantum decoherence
is the loss of quantum coherence, and decoherence can be viewed as the loss of information from a system into the
environment (often modelled as a heat bath), since every system is loosely coupled with the energetic state of its
surroundings (Bacon, 2001). It was Schrödinger who recognized that coherent interaction of waves is coupled to
entanglement as “the characteristic aspect of quantum mechanics” and suggested that “eigenstates” can survive
interaction with the environment. In quantum mechanics, all objects have wave-like properties (see de Broglie
waves). A toroidal quantum equation of a coherent entangled distribution of energy (3D semi-harmonic oscillator)
has been derived, that is in line with the earlier published models of Bacon, 2001) and Fröhlich (1968, 1969, 1977,
1988).

7. Vibration Frequencies of Neuronal Microtubules in Experiments in vitro
In quantum physics, complementarity of non-interchangeable observables, such as location, can be related to a
wave function of entanglement in the complex number space that can be positioned in a nested toroidal geometry
(Fig. 7). In this space, life systems and organs such as brain are permanently embedded and, consequently, this is
also true for organelles within the various cell types in brain such as the microtubules. The conformational states of
micro-tubules have typical spatial arrangements of tubulin proteins, that collectively form filaments that are
instrumental in the guiding of building, homeostasis, decay and apoptosis of living cells, Fig.8)

Figure 8: Microtubular vibrations and quantum resonance, hypothesized as being involved in the generation of
consciousness. A: Tubules with tubulin protein -isomers in nervous system such as axons and dendrites; B: Spatial

structure of tubulins organized in spiralling geometry in the microtubules; C: Pyramidal organization of tubules and

wave function through resonant information wave congruence with informational ripples at the Planck scale (right
below, a mechanism that endorses the concept of zero-point energy guiding of our brain, (Meijer, 2019) ,with
discrete EMF frequencies(figure and insets modified from Hameroff and Penrose, 2014).
Disturbances of microtubules have been observed to the spindle apparatus (a mitotic structure comprised of
microtubules) in hybrid cells (Hintzsche et al. 2011) and disassembly of polymerized microtubules at a non-thermal
level has been observed to occur within minutes of an applied train of THz pulses, depending on the intensity and
frequency content of the applied pulse (Hough et al. 2018). The many measured Eigen-wave frequencies of
microtubules, measured in the group of Bandyopadhyai (Fig.10),and other groups (Fig.11), were analyzed through
meta-analysis and, to our initial surprise, were precisely positioned at the pointer states of the toroidal quantum
equation of coherence and decoherence proposed by us, with a fit with the acoustic quantum code model (Geesink
and Schmieke, 2022).
Interestingly, there may be a relation between the presence of the basic 13-units for microtubules and the 13
scalars implicit in the proposed quantum equation of coherence. It was earlier inferred that the involved 4D
geometry of life can be viewed upon as created through symmetry breaking from a so called 5D- homogenous
domain, as described by Wong et al., 2020, Meijer and Wong, 2020, 2021. The vibration model found in the
present paper, thus probably reflects a close relation with the electromagnetic ordering of microtubules. Within
the typically organized microtubules, the tubular proteins are arranged in a spiral way. Biopolymers such as of
actin, microtubulins and DNA are well known for their self-organization phenomena in vivo . Considerable efforts
have been devoted to describe their geometric organization process in vitro, that indeed produced ring-shaped or
toroidal structures in an irreversible manner (Rashedul Kabir, 2012). The centrosome represents the main
microtubule organization centre and is composed of a centriole pair, surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM).
Interphase PCM components, interestingly, adopt a concentric toroidal distribution of discrete diameter around
centrioles (Lawo, 2012).
Microtubules and related motor proteins have been investigated in detail in various laboratories, showing that
such structures are populated by a high density of defects, being tiny regions where the local alignment is lost,(Ellis
et al. 2017). Here we report that the measured frequencies of brain waves, as well as those of microtubules, obey
the known frequency patterns, described by the proposed quantum equation of coherence that also exhibit a
toroidal geometry (Geesink, 2018d). In our meta-analysis, apart from coherent frequency values, we identified also
some decoherent values (see later). Therefore, we consider the possibility that the toroidal organisation of
microtubules is only possible by the intermittent pattern of coherent wave activity, intertwined with a decoherent
oscilltions of proteins, (Fig.9). This intermittent frequency pattern has indeed been found for a nematic order on
curved surfaces and is disrupted by the presence of topological defects (decoherent states), which are singular
regions in which the orientational order is undefined, implying defects in the otherwise aligned material (Ellis et al.
2017), see Fig. 9 and 10. All measured and analysed frequencies of healthy microtubules comply with a similar
energy distribution as found for Bose Einstein Condensates. The overall results therefore clearly show a presence of
an informational quantum code, and a direct relation with the Eigen-frequencies of microtubules, and brain waves.
A measured spectrum of MIR and FIR-data for microtubules has been presented in the earlier published Database,
(Geesink, 2022b).

22

What are the implications for neurotransmission and electric activity in the brain? Sahu et al, (2013 a, b, 2014),
demonstrated a quantum spectrum of coherent vibration bands in isolated micro-tubules and suggested this
phenomenon as the very basis for information processing in neuronal systems. Resonance peaks of isolated
microtubules have been measured and typical dominating peaks were found as the most probable resonance peaks
of the micro-tubulins. The latter can be related to regulation, ordering and growth of microtubules. Also,
substantial stiffening of single filaments has been found above a characteristic transition frequency, in the range of
1–30 Hz depending on the filament’s molecular composition (Sahu, 2013, 2014; Koch, 2017), (see Fig.9). The
microtubules (MTs) were therefore claimed to be involved as sub-cellular information or quantum information and
cellular communication systems through a distinct effect on neurotransmitter release/ reuptake, processes that are
essential for generation of action potentials and propagated nerve pulses. It follows that alterations in the microtubular processes may be translated in macro-effects of brain physiology. Such electronic phenomena are also
found in physics and MTs are the closest biological equivalent to meta-materials (Pizzi et al., 2010).
The discovery of warm temperature quantum vibrations in microtubules inside brain neurons by the research
group of Bandyopadhyay and also other groups, may imply that EEG rhythms, as analyzed by us, could partly be
derived from deeper level microtubule vibrations (Bandyopadhyay, 2013; Agrawal, 2017, 2018). Yet, It was earlier
debated if quantum wave information in the brain can become directly expressed, considering the supposed
extremely short coherence times. That is, if there is no efficient shielding from the environment (see discussion on
this topic in Hameroff and Penrose (2012,2014).

connection of wave resonance of MT oscillations with cosmic gravitational waves at the Planck scale and/or at the
ZPE field level. Note: apart from the coherent frequencies in MT oscillation listed above, also a number of
decoherent values were identified (see Geesink, 2022b)
Many observations show that the excitations of the MT vibration occur at relatively odd wave numbers and
particularly even half wave numbers. These oscillations are very sensitive to the selected frequency of the chosen
electromagnetic field, and accordingly, showed narrow or sharp peaks in the amplitude–frequency spectra (Si Liu,
et al. 2019). Self-similar symmetry structures at all frequency scales have been found over a time domain of 106
order in time scale (Saxena, 2020). We were rather surprised to see that the measured MT peaks at MHz and GHz
frequencies precisely fit with the typical frequency positions and patterns described by the proposed quantum
equation of coherence, see Fig.9), in which a toroidal geometric order is described by this equation within a wide
0

fractal frequency scale from 10 till 10

14

Hz, (Geesink and Schmieke, 2022).

Figure 10: A Left: Raman spectra of Tubulin and Micotubule (Choudhury, 2013; B: Decomposition spectrum of
microtubule Raman spectrum. Solution form shows 24 distinct peaks (Zhang and Craddock et al., 2022)
Pitkänen, 2014, considered that such findings about microtubules may have a relation with his general TGD model
and his view about topological quantum computation (TQC). The idea is that flux tubes form a 2-D coordinate grid,
consist of parallel flux tubes in two different directions. Crossing points would be associated with tubulins, and the
conformational state of tubulin could thereby define a bit coding in which the braid strands defining coordinate
lines are braided or not. In this manner any bit pattern at the microtubule may define a particular TQC. The
conformations are probably quantum superposed, and the grids for A and B type lattices are related by 2π twist for
the second end of the basic 13-unit for microtubule (Pitkänen, 2014).
The Raman spectra of a microtubule and of the molecular bond vibrations show Fano resonances, that are the
eigenstates calculated by the proposed quantum equation of coherence of Geesink and Meijer, which are indicative
of quantum coupling between discrete phonon vibrational states and continuous excitonic many-body spectra. The
observed Fano resonances can be interpreted as interferences between the discrete phonon and continuous

24

excitonic many-body spectra, (Fig.6 and 7), and the resonances give rise to line-shapes, that can be positioned at
surfaces of nested torii (Zhang, 2022; Chen, Y., Geesink, 2022a, b, Meijer and Geesink , 2022).

8. Coherence as a Crucial Factor Determining Graded States of Consciousness
Next to healthy and unhealthy states, as analyzed in the present paper and treated above, there is possibly a
relation between graded consciousness and relative degree of coherence of global brain waves. A further step in
brain neurobiology towards the understanding of the generation of consciousness, is the research on quantum
mechanical brain processes, that is supposed to affect neural network functions (Meijer and Geesink, 2017, Meijer
et al, 2020). This idea is presently intensively discussed (see Meijer, 2016, Hameroff and Penrose, 2017) that, if
quantum physics is involved in the normal working of the brain, diseased conditions of the brain such as
psychopathology: depression, anxiety, dementia, schizophrenia and hallucinations may , at least partly, be
explained by quantum physical perturbations. General classifications have been made for a multitude of current
models for quantum brain theory, (see Meijer, 2016, Hameroff and Penrose, 2017). In the paper “Quantum logic of
the unconscious and schizophrenia”, (Zizzi and Pregnolato, 2012;2013), it was hypothesized that the logic of the
unconscious is co-extensive with the logic of schizophrenia . It should be emphasised here that the term
consciousness is a container term with a spectrum of different meanings and expressed in numerous models and
explanatory profiles. Two recent studies bring some systematic in this field: Doerig et al.,2020 formulated hard
criteria for empirical theories of consciousness that are currently in competition, while Signorelli et al., 2021a,
attempted a systematic classification on the basis of various modes of explanation of the models at stake.

8.1 The Meaning of the Terms Coherence and Decoherence
The discrete coherent and decoherent frequency bands in our studies are arranged according to an alternating
ordering, while decoherent bands and transition frequencies are located just in between these frequency bands
(Geesink, 2018a), see Figures 3 and 3b. Mutual coherent ordering of bio-molecules can occur in a surrounding in
which small frequency shifts can take place, that balance between coherent and transition zones, on the contrary
apoptosis and necrosis can take place by morphological patterns, that are characterized by decoherent patterns. It
is proposed that frequency shifts from coherent to transition zones and vice versa can occur by: 1) intensity
changes of overlapped bands, 2) (de)bonding of hydrogen bonds, 3) changing of dipole–dipole interactions. It has
been found in the meta-analyses that underlying causes of unhealthy situations by non-thermal external
electromagnetic waves can be related to the different states of biological aspects, that can be disturbed:
conformational states of proteins, pre-conformational states of protein folding, genome conformational states,
conformational states of ion-gates, conformational states of neurotransmitters, conformational dynamics of DNA,
and ATP-arrangements. The disturbances of the mentioned biological aspects can be further related to
corresponding physical disturbances like: conformational states of ion water clathrates, short- and long-range
electromagnetic interactions, conformational states of electrons, soliton waves and tunnelling frequencies.
It has been discussed in the prior sections, that external non-thermal electromagnetic waves are able to steer the
proposed transitional modes in living cells, located just in between the coherent and decoherent modes, into one
of the other zones: the coherent or decoherent ones (Fig. 3 a b). This is depending upon the types of the external
EMF frequencies employed if they are located in the coherent or decoherent modes. Not only decoherent
electromagnetic base signals are able to cause unhealthy situations, but occasionally also coherent base signals
25

modulated with estimated decoherent frequency patterns are in some cases also able to cause unhealthy conditins,
in and for example the 900 MHz GSM-pulsed, and studies that apply a single coherent signal at for example 900
MHz show no biological effect. Coherent base signals, when combined with coherent modulations also show no or
healthy effects (see for instance appendix 2.5, in a comprehensive overview of Geesink and Meijer, 2020.
In general, decoherence should not always be interpreted as fully detrimental for biological processes. For example,
It should be mentioned here that, noise can also play a facilitatory role in neuronal processing and reliability of
communication, according to principles of stochastic resonance (SR). It has been shown that, if the exogenous noise
is properly filtered and its level is adjusted, a clear optimization of the network encoding of an electromagnetic
signal, is obtained through the stochastic resonance (Paffi et al. 2013). Noise intensities maximizing spiking activity
coherence with the exogenous EM signal are clearly shown, indicating a stochastic resonant behavior, strictly
connected to the model frequency sensitivity. In this study SR exhibits a window of occurrence in the values of field
frequency and intensity, which is a kind of effect long reported in bio-electromagnetic experimental studies
(Gianni, 2006).
For the present study, we should therefore clarify here again the terms coherent and decoherent somewhat more
in detail. Decoherence is often seen as meaning disorder and/or chaotic conditions. Yet, it should be emphasized
that decoherent states in physics are likely a necessary condition for both animate and non-animate systems:
coherence seems always projected against a background of decoherence. Examples are the essential role of noise
(decoherent sound waves) in photosynthesis, facilitating the passage of the photon energy generated excitons
through the protein-pigment matrix, underway to the ATP producing energy center of the photosynthetic
machinery (Mirovic et al., 2017; Chin et al., 2012). With regards to physical systems, the zero-point energy field
fluctuations, being stochastic in nature, and thus displaying decoherent oscillations, while also (coherent) ZPE
standing wave are formed, identified by us earlier as discrete frequencies of quantum fluctuations. (Meijer, 2021).
One could imagine that this coherence/decoherence relation is due to a process of symmetry breaking from a
homogeneous spacetime manifold (see Meijer and Wong, 2021, 2022).As mentioned above, the series of ground
numbers of our quantum code algorithm, from which the entire harmonic set of octave based frequencies of 12
series can be calculated, can be directly related to Chern numbers, that express the total volume of quantum flux.
This, apart from the involvement of coherent toroidal patterns, can only be envisioned by the interfering toroidal
trajectories of a disordered character, by which multiple crossroads in the energy distribution trajectories (torus
windings) are formed that than are expressed as Chern numbers, (Meijer and Geesink, 2022). The latter are always
whole integer numbers and the basic ground numbers of our algorithm with broken numbers should be seen as a
fine-distribution of 12 tones within the range of 1.0-2.0 Hz, while the fractal adjacent windows of 12 up to GHz and
THz , can be found by multiplying by 2n as known in harmonics.
8.2 Coherence, Decoherence and Entanglement in Quantum Physics: Are they Functionally Connected?
It should be emphasized here that macro- coherence in electric brain activity is exhibited at a very different level
than the known quantum coherence and decoherence at the quantum level. The latter is usually described in
relation to wave/particle duality as a collapse of the quantum wave function to the particle form through
interaction with the environment. Some see this process as an irreversible event, yet other workers in this field
rather see this as a dynamic equilibrium state with mutual transitions. Kaufmann, 2010, framed this as a poised
state in which decoherent states are reverseably generated by loss of information from the coherent state and in
which the reversed process can thus be modified by the addition of information. A connection was even was even

26

assumed by the finding that for efficient exciton transport in process of photosynthesis background noise (phonon
vibrations) is essential for promoting of this process( Mirovic et al., 2017; Chin et al., 2012).
8.3 Quantum Coherence in Relation to Quantum Entanglement
Quantum coherence and quantum entanglement are two landmark features of quantum physics, and physicists
have demonstrated that the two phenomena are "operationally equivalent", that is, equivalent for practical
purposes, yet they conceptually are distinct processes. This finding allowed physicists to study entanglement to
the more fundamental level in relation to the less-well-researched concept of coherence/decoherence balance.
Although physicists have suggested that coherence and entanglement are close relatives, the exact relationship
between the two resources has not become clear (see Zyga, 2020).
It's well-known that quantum coherence and quantum entanglement are both rooted in the superposition
principle, being the phenomenon in which a single quantum state simultaneously consists of multiple state, but
clearly in different ways. Quantum coherence deals with the idea that all objects have wave-like properties. If an
object's wave-like nature is split in two, then the two waves may coherently interfere with each other in such a way
as to form a single state that is a superposition of the two states. Coherence also lies at the heart of quantum
computing, in which a qubit is in a superposition of the "0" and "1" states, resulting in a speed-up over various
classical algorithms. When such a state experiences decoherence, however, all of its quantumness is typically lost
and the advantage vanishes, (Fig. 11).

Figure 11: A: Exposure of cells to a spectrum of EMF frequencies produces physical influences at very different levels
in the cell; B: Incoherent operations cannot generate entanglement from incoherent input states. (b) Conversely, any
27

nonzero coherence in the input state of a system S can be converted to entanglement via incoherent operations on S
and an incoherent ancilla B: Input coherence and output entanglement are quantitatively equivalent: For any
entanglement monotone E, the maximum entanglement generated between S and A by incoherent operations
defines a faithful coherence. Entanglement stems from the superposition principle, which is also the essence of
coherence.(from Streltsov, 2015) C: Multiple wave particles from the same source can be entangled; D: Photons in
an entangled state can be stored in a holographic manner and subsequent correlation yield complex memory states
(left).
The second phenomenon, quantum entanglement, also involves superposition. But in this case, the states in a
superposition are the shared states of two entangled particles rather than those of the two split waves of a single
particle. The intrigue of entanglement thus lies in the fact that the two entangled particles are so intimately
correlated that a measurement on one particle instantly affects the other particle, even when separated by a large
distance (Fig.11).
Like coherence, quantum entanglement also plays an essential role in various quantum technologies, such as
quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and super-dense coding. In a paper published in Physical Review
Letters, Streltsof et al., 2015, have provided a powerful, answer to the question of how these two resources are
related (see Fig.11). Despite having the same roots of origin, namely quantum superposition, coherence and
entanglement are conceptually very different. For example, coherence can be present in single quantum systems,
where entanglement is not well-defined. Also, coherence is defined with respect to a given basis, while
entanglement is invariant under local basis changes. The operational equivalence of coherence and entanglement
will likely have a far-reaching impact on areas ranging from quantum information theory to more nascent fields
such as quantum biology and nano-scale thermodynamics. In the future, these physicists plan to investigate
whether coherence and entanglement might also be interconverted into a third resource,that of quantum discord,
which, like entanglement, is another type of quantum correlation between two systems. On the practical side, the
authors are investigating schemes to detect, quantify, and preserve coherence, entanglement and other quantum
correlations in noisy environments.
We have earlier investigated how EMF -frequencies influence the phenomenon of entanglement by performing a
meta-analysis on a series of reports that describe a promoting effects of electromagnetic fields on the degree of
entanglement in the so called EPR experiments (Geesink and Meijer, 2018). In view of the current interest in
coherency and entanglement in quantum biology in general, we reported on a meta-analysis of 60 papers in physics
that deal with the influence of electromagnetic frequencies on the promotion of entangled states in, so called, EPR
(Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen) experiment. The meta-analyses of the EPR-experiments learned that entanglement,
achieved in the experiments is real, and that the applied EMF frequencies are located at discrete coherent
configurations. Strikingly, all analyzed EPR-data of the independent studies fit precisely in the derived scale of
coherent frequency data and turned out to be virtually congruent with the above mentioned semi-harmonic EMscale for living organisms. Frequency data of EPR experiments (1972-2017), were thus positioned in a coherent GMscale of frequencies. EMF-exposures at frequencies are in the bands of MHz, GHz, PHz,, as described above. In this
frequency distribution pattern decoherent wave frequencies could not be established , probably, since the
particular scientists only reported positive effects on degree of entanglement. Recently, the influence of
electromagnetic fields on quantum entanglement of harmonic oscillator was demonstrated (Makarov, 2018).
This implies that the same discrete coherent frequency pattern of EM quantum waves that promote entanglement,
also determine local and non-local states of biological order and that quantum entanglement may therefore be a
28

prerequisite for life and consciousness. In relation to brain function Poznanski claimed surpringly that quantum
entanglement perse is not essential for the creation of consciousness (Poznanski et al., 2019), although he states
that it arises from the brain binding of neg-entropic entangled information, reflecting dynamic patterns of thermoqubits. The latter are supposed to be encoded in labile phase differences of thermo-quantum fluctuations that,
according to Poznanski, requires incoherency in creating neg-entropic action. Here the question arise how the
overall brain does evaluate and select neg-entropic information flux over entropic flow, since this requires an
integral and updated self-referential memory framework as proposed by us (Meijer et al 2020). This would occur
through an implicit top-down guiding principle that also includes anticipation of the future, about what could have
happened. We hold that a dedicated holographic memory workspace, (see our model treated in section 11), is
instrumental here, that also connects our brain with a the fine space-time geometry in the form of defined
information fields at the Planck- and Zero-point energy scale, as earlier proposed by Penrose (see Hameroff, 2022)
and Meijer et al., 2020).
8.4 Are Brain and Spacetime Fractals, Quantum Coherent in the Golden Mean?
As mentioned in the methods section, the synchronization of the excitatory phases of two oscillators become not
possible when their ratio equals the golden mean Phi (Φφ), since it offers a totally uncoupling processing
(desynchronizing) state that represents the resting brain in which no information processing occurs. In music theory
this is called tone separation, absolutely necessary to appreciate music. It began in 1932 when Russian physicist Lev
Landau found that intersecting plasma waves exchange energy across a tiny vortex called a “damping well.” Then in
1997, another study found Landau damping wells follow Fibonacci proportions in magnetic standing waves. Today
we know it is Fibonacci vortices at golden sections in standing waves that distribute energy and enable harmonic
formation (Fig.12, below of Merrick, see his Interference Theory).

Figure 12: Fibonacci vortices provide tone damping wells for essential wave separation
Without ‘Phi-damping,’ standing waves could not properly form, and particles would not exist. For brain
physiology this aspect has been clearly described by Pletzer et al., 2010 and Klimesh, 2013, showing that in the
doubling/halving harmonic phase coupling, small deviations can lead to spurious phase synchronization and that
this easily can disturb the chain of neighboring harmonics. Such long distance chains are likely related to size of
the participating neural networks in which their reciprocal connections exhibit a preferred length.The authors also
show the harmonic coupling of EEG frequencies with heart rate and other known oscillation frequency states in
the whole body. Heart beat can reset brain acutivity and synchronicity state in the brain may be crucial for
29

cognition and the setting of active conscious states versus transition to the slow wave of drowsiness and sleep,
with scale invariant harmonic relations. This suggest that this harmonic algorithm may reflect a basic law of
information coding and long distance communication in nature that requires the least amount of energy, which is
very much in line with the cosmic aspects of our present acoustic quantum code model Meijer et al. 2020. Meijer
and Wong, 2022). It was shown by Rodriguez-Larios and Alaerts, 2019, that there are clear harmonic
relationships between theta and alpha peaks, facilitating cognitive performance. A similar message was earlier
communicated by Weiss and Weiss, 2003, and was recently confirmed by Kramer, 2022, also pointing out that
cross-frequency interactions of rhythmic triplets with varying coupling strength promote resonance beteen
neural networks.
In an earlier report on the golden mean as clock cycle of brain waves by Weiss and Weiss, 2003, indicating a
correlation of Φφ with memory span and intelligence. If we understand span as the quantum number n of a
harmonic oscillator, we can in principle obtain this result from the EEG. The metric of brain waves can always be
understood as a superposition of n harmonics times 2, where half of the fundamental is the golden mean Φφ (
1.618) as the point of resonance. Such wave packets scaled in powers of the golden mean have to be understood
as numbers with directions, where bifurcations occur at the edge of chaos. Pascual-Leone understands memory
span as the maximum of discrete and equal energy units (i.e. quanta), which every subject has at his disposal. The
most extreme compression of information is represented by the eigenvalues of the power spectrum. In such a
way memory span has to be understood as the quantum of action of thought. In fact, these quanta of action
represent macroscopic ordered states in the sense of quantum mechanics. Higher IQ subjects have not only a
higher memory span, but consequently also more complex waveforms of EEG than lower IQ subjects. Datta [39]
showed how a sense of time and evolution is intrinsically defined by the infinite continued fraction of the golden
mean and its inverse. Time thereby undergoes random inversions generating well-defined random scales, thus
allowing a dynamical system to evolve self similarly over the set of multiple scales. These random fluctuations
generate 1=f noise, which is one of the footprints of complexity at the critical border between predictable
periodic behavior and chaos. The most extreme compression of information is represented by the eigenvalues of
the power spectrum
According to Weiss and Weiss,2003, there can be no doubt that our brain for computing uses inherent and
inborn properties of the physical universe. Quantum mechanics seems to require the quantization of all physical
quantities on the small scale, yet space and time are still treated in most cases as a classical space–time
continuum, where there are an infinite number of space points between any two given locations, no matter how
close. Because Hz, oscillations per second, is superficially seen only a man-made measure, this seems to be the
weakest point of our line of reasoning. Behind the definition of the second is the velocity of light (c = 299. 792 458
m/s), which is the constant on which size all other physical constants depend upon and hence represents the
inherent speed limit that any particle information pattern is able to achieve. In this system of present-day
constants the Planck length has the value 1.6160 · 10^35 m). If we fix instead the Planck length at the value of the
golden mean at 1.6180 · 10^35 m and recalculate consequently all other physical variables, this means for the
numerical size of the second only a trivial correction not relevant for our argument. Indeed, there is a growing
minority of scholars who understand the world as something like a cellular automaton running with and counting
numbers. The numerical state of all the cells, everywhere, changes at a regular synchronised interval called a
clock cycle. The universal cellular automaton seems to be capable of updating its entire memory in a single clock
cycle, which according to Occams razor could be nothing else than the Planck time as the relation between the
velocity of light and the Planck length, the latter fixed at the value of the golden mean.

30

In the following, the important work, in this respect, of Ho, el Naschie and Vitello, 2015, is shortly summarized . It
appears indeed likely that spacetime is fractal and quantum coherent in the golden mean. Nature abounds with
cycles and oscillations, from subatomic vibrations to planetary motion, solar cycles and galactic rotations. Some,
like Penrose and Gurzadyan (Gurzadyan and Penrose, 2013), hold that the Universe cycles through deaths and
rebirths, based on data collected by NASAs WMAP. Physically, it appears to be a quantum coherent universe
consisting of an infinite diversity of autonomous agents all participating in co-creating organic, fractal spacetime by
their multitudes of coupled cycles of activities. Biologically, this fractal coherent spacetime is also the fabric of
conscious awareness mirrored in the quantum coherence/ golden mean brain states.
This is very important for understanding how cyclic activities (or oscillators)interact with one another. The
trajectories of Hamiltonian systems in phase space are confined to a doughnut shaped surface, of an invariant
torus. Different initial conditions that will trace different invariant concentric Tori in phase space, are separated
by unstable chaotic regions, where the motion is irregular and unpredictable. The golden mean effectively
enables multiple oscillators within a complex system, able to co-exist without blowing up the system. But it also
leaves the oscillators within the system free to interact globally (by resonance), which may have important
applications in the study of the brain. The authors looked at the circle map and considered that the golden mean
critical point (GM) is where the curve of constant irrational winding number, and quasi-periodic behavior
undergoes transition to chaos. This point is marked by an infinite sequence of unstable orbits with periods given
by the Fibonacci numbers. The golden mean is thus located at the edge of chaos, and has a role in keeping the
system of oscillators active without interfering with one another as well as away from the state of chaos.
The fractal hierarchy of coupled cycles confers dynamic stability as well as autonomy to the system on every
scale. Thermodynamically, no net entropy is generated in the case of perfect cycles; and the system
maintains its organization. Thus, organic spacetime exists as a hierarchy of simultaneities, or durations, precisely
as envisaged by Bergson : the golden fractal of neuronal activities is the key to optimum intercommunication and
information processing where fractals are mathematically isomorphic to quantum coherent states. The coherent
fractal structure maximizes global connectivity and local autonomy, as the hallmark of quantum coherence,
Quantum coherence thus seems to underly the ubiquitous recurrence of fractal self-similarity in Nature. This is to
be expected because entropy controls time irreversibility and the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry, that is
characteristic of dissipation, is clearly manifest in the formation process of fractals. In the case of the logarithmic
spiral, the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is associated with the chirality of the spiral: the indirect (righthanded) spiral is the time-reversed, but distinct, image of the direct (left-handed) spiral.
Coherent Brain Waves, Scale-Free Laws and Fractals
Observations clearly show that the coherent cortical activities cannot be fully accounted for by the electric field of
the extracellular dendritic current or the extracellular magnetic field from the high-density electric current inside
the dendritic shafts, nor by chemical diffusion. Spatially extended patterns of phase-locked oscillations are
intermittently present in resting, awake subjects, and in the same subjects actively engaged in cognitive tasks.
They are best described as properties of the brain modulated upon engagement with the environment.
Umezawa's many-body model is based on the quantum field theoretic notion of spontaneous breakdown of
symmetry which requires the existence of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mass-less particles. Examples are the phonon
modes in crystals, the magnon modes in ferro-magnets, etc. The quantum variables relevant to the many-body
model of the brain have been identified to be the electric dipole vibration modes of the water molecules that
constitute the matrix in which neurons and glia cells are embedded The spontaneous breakdown of the rotational
symmetry of electrical dipoles of water and other molecules implies the existence of NG-modes.
31

Golden Music of the Brain Mirrors the Universe
In living systems, fractals must satisfy the state of quantum coherence which maximizes global cohesion as well as
local autonomy, and enables energy from any local level to spread to the global and conversely concentrate
energy to any domain from the entire system. Physically, it represents a quantum coherent universe consisting of
an infinite diversity of autonomous agents all participating in co-creating organic, fractal spacetime by their
multitudinous coupled activity cycles. Biologically, this fractal coherent space-time could also provide the fabric of
conscious awareness mirrored in the quantum coherence of our brain states. This view depicts a new organic
cosmogony, consonant with that of Alfred North Whitehead , resolving major paradoxes associated with the
classical mechanics, and paving the way to reconciling or transcending quantum theory and general relativity see
Meijer, 2023, submitted).
It is of great interest that brain function was recently described by Singh et al., 2020, on the basis of a selfoperating time crystal model of human brain, in which multiple brain clocks are conceived as acting in concert in
a 3D fractal architecture of clocks, that together may represent the entire brain hardware. The striking structural
similarity of neuronal networks and cosmic web of filament connected galactic networks were earlier treated by
us in a paper on ”The Elemental Intelligence of the Cosmos and the Acoustic Quantum Code of Resonant
Coherence”, (Meijer and Ivaldi, 2022).

9. Consciousness: the Relation with Overall Brain Function and Variable EEG-coherence
As shown in Table 3, and in the many other EEG-tracks in the published data base, Geesink, 2022b), peak values
can be clearly identified in the the overall EEG wave patterns, in order to be compared with the coherence values
of our algorithm. This was done for all of the EEG tracks published in the indicated individual articles ( see database
Geesink, 2022b) and were marked in green (coherent) or red (decoherent) vertical lines, (see Table 3 and Fig.5). A
significant deviation from a coherence position was defined as a value maximally deviating of 10% or more. The
total number of coherent peakvalues were averaged per patient group and the mean value was depicted together
with the particular frequency range, (see Table 3). The % coherent values in the particular frequencies of the
coherent value was indicated for each patient group of mental disorder patients with healthy individuals as
controls. Apart from the de ADHD group, the coherence values in the other mental disorders were significantly
different comared with te group of healty individuals at a p=0.05 level (Wilcoxon test).
Brain cells generate electrical signals and these combined signals yield oscillations known as brain waves, which can
be measured by multi-channel EEG technology, among others, quantifying the degree to which the brain is globally
coherent. The coherent or synchronized functioning of brain waves basically means that the brain waves reflect
collective activity in various detectable brain modules, (see Fig. 1),and show slow alpha, beta, gamma or theta
waves at the same time. Subjects tested on rapid visual recognition reveal the greatest alpha brain wave
coherence between distant brain areas (alpha waves associated with being alert and relaxed) were most successful
at the task. There is some unknown mechanism that allows these resonance patterns to form, and these circuits
than sort of start “humming together”.
Such collective vibrations may also foster long-term plasticity changes in the brain, so real anatomical brain circuits
can be created. Simultaneously stimulating the two frontal areas increased the brain wave coherence between
these areas at the theta frequency, and the investigated individual learned faster, made more rapid decisions
32

without making errors, Conversely, the researchers could disrupt a person’s brain coherence by sending electrical
currents at different times, (Marcus, 2021). It was shown earlier that synchronize neuronal network activity
generates weak electric fields in the brain that can be measured by EEG monitoring in humans and also in brain
slices in vitro. These fields are instrumental in helping groups of neurons to maintain a synchronized activity
pattern. It is of great interest that this occurs through resonant harmonic conditions, in the sense that stimulation
at multiples of intrinsic frequencies has a privileged effect on the amplitude of ongoing oscillations Marcus, 2021.
This principle that also can be applied in transcranial electric current stimulation and is in line with our algorithm of
coherence.

Multiple neurological studies clearly indicate that graded states of consciousness can be monitored by EEG
measurements, either by multichannel technology or more detailed analysis after decomposition of the raw EEG
data in the characteristic alpha, beta, gamma, delta and theta brainwave patterns, (see Fig.1).These power spectra
show differential effects when such brainwaves are observed during daydreaming, meditation, and also ketamine
versus propofol anesthesia. fMRI detection confirm the idea that perturbation or loss of consciousness is due to an
inter-areal coordination, long-range brain coherence and in general to functional brain connectivity and global
integration representing information processing (Demertzi et al,2019; Luppi et al., 2020). Brain signal coordination
reveals a landscape of consciousness by using such a harmonic decomposition of the connectome as guided by
both gray and white brain matter. It is shown that integral connectivity is expressed in a modular brain structure
(multiple locally connected networks) that in the learning processes of the young enable task-directed
specialization and of which the overall brain distribution becomes more separated at older age (Cheng et al, 2021).
Nevertheless, our results on the major loss of brain coherence in anesthesia (see Table 3), as defined by our
quantum algorithm frequency pattern, exhibits the crucial role of EMF (Photon/Phonon) mediated signal
transmission for a functioning modality of consciousness.

The integration of information as a central item in the Integrated Information theory of Tononi and Koch, 2015, has
also been approached by high-density EEG and could, in principle, be used for differentiation in states of
consciousness (Kim et al., 2016). Here the question can be raised which type of signaling is at stake in these global
brain communication processes. Although there are speculation on long range axons connecting distant brain
areas, and probably involved in generation of conscious states, it is more likely that communication is achieved on
the basis of the presence of neural EMF fields (Mc Fadden, 2020). The original proposal of Baars et al., 2021 and
other authors that favor the global workspace hypothesis, imply of a “long range broadcasting signaling” in brain
that, in our opinion, is still speculative. Obviously, it fails to define the physical mechanisms for such a broadcasting
process and does not make clear how the dedicated antennes for receiving and deciphering of the particular
information codes are constituted. Another problem is how the chaotic brain manages to distinguish and fine-tune
the information transfer. We hold that for these collective aspects global resonant coherence is required, in
addition to an updated memory workspace that allows error correction and a field-receptive profile that represents
the individual self as placed in a permanently changing outer-world.
Applying electrical charges to the brain is sometimes called “transcranial stimulation,” and there are important
problems in its use. A neuroscience article of Hamid et al, 2015 , noted that side effects are found with such
procedures, including headaches, nausea, and fatigue, and it should be realized that the long-term effects of
repetitive electrical brain stimulation are largely unknown. So, it seems logical, in general, that a coherent brain
would function better than an incoherent one. But can we induce brain synchrony without sending electrical
signals to the brain and risking such invasive side effects? Interestingly, also western scientists discovered the
33

benefits of brain wave synchrony or coherence by applying various “Transcendental Meditation” techniques.
Certain meditations practices reliably produce brain coherence. The theory is that a meditation techniques that
teaches the use of Sanskrit mantras (special sounds), trigger brain cells to oscillate in a coherent way, resembling
the tuning of a pitch fork that causes a nearby object to oscillate in the same way.

10. Multi-dimensional Space-time Including an Extra (4th) Spatial Dimension in
Consciousness Studies
Carlson, 2020, pointed out that we do not perceive physical space and that in fact we are restricted in conceiving it.
This, actually, provides the purpose of science: to build a predictive causal framework for our scattered
perceptions. The author approached the 4D-manifold by the causal set theory in which any change of space-like
interval is a purely structural consequence of the stepping action of time. Using a time fork, followed by two step
converging time series and forming a reconverging sequence, a time triangle is created. In this manner, spacetime
and dimensionality can be build up from such triadic patterns formed by temporal successions.
Time has been designated to the position of a fourth dimension, so we live our everyday lives in 3 dimensions plus
1: time together forming space-time. Although our brains can imagine objects only in the 3 spatial dimensions,
some concept of higher dimensions is, in priciple, possible. For example, a hypercube of 4 spatial dimensions may
be appreciated by examining its 3-dimensional shadow. It has been proposed that light is a vibration in the fifth
dimension.
An interesting study in this respect, as to brain function, was performed by Walling (2003, 2020), in which EEG
patterns were recorded in different stages of recovery from deep general anethesia. The availability of powerful
computers for data analysis resulted in an approach in the field of nonlinear dynamics. The signals were analyzed
according to non-linear dynamics and showed distinct patterns with attractor dimensions that invariably went
point, periodic and toroidal before the chaotic brain pattern emerged. The smallest attractors registered (1.3–2.0
dimensions) all involved subjects that were meditating or at prayer. Under these conditions, the conscious mind is
closed to the senses while the subject concentrates on the prayer or meditates. In contrast, the highest number of
dimensions was detected at multitasking.
Thus, each signal inhabits its own dimensional manner to move from one dimension to another. In this way, the
signals are separate but bound together at the same time. In other words, sensory binding has been accomplished,
while the perception of vision and hearing are kept separate. The layers are deposited at about 40 Hz and the
higher dimensional, apparently seamless percept may represent a content of more than three dimensions. Thus, by
employing nonphysical perceptual space, the percipient is freed from the constraint imposed by the event horizon
of three-dimensional physical space. In humans, Walling has shown that nonlinear dynamics may exist in the form
of higher-dimensional fractal attractors up to a value of 4.8 dimensions. A 4.8-dimension attractor may combine
more than 4 variables in phase space, (Fig. 13).
The team has also shown evidence of nonlinear dynamic activity in the brains of animals, activity that seems to
increase in complexity among various species in a logical progression. To look for signs of nonlinear dynamics, the
team again analyzed data from electroencephalographs of 11 different species. This was done in order to see
whether an increase in mathematical sophistication across species correlated with preconceived notions regarding
evolutionary ranking in the central nervous systems of the animals. The electroencephalograph correlation
dimensions from the 6 animals were plotted against their age as estimated from the fossil record in millions of
34

years. They showed that the greatest attractor dimensions for these species increased steadily during the period of
animal evolution (Fig. 13). The shape of the curve took the form of a logarithmic spiral, obviously being self-similar.
Thus, the more variables there are in a nonlinear system, the more dimensions are needed to accommodate them.
Conversely, the higher the dimension of the fractal attractor, the greater the number of variables that are required
to represent it. Consequently, the fractal attractor Walling et al. observed could be evidence of a repository for the
information required for higher-dimensional brain activity. The attractors may, in fact, represent the” knot” where
the “binding” of information occurs. In conclusion: all investigated species, including humans, showed evidence of
fractal attractors in brain EEG activity and demonstrated increasing fractal dimensions commensurate with their
status in evolutionary development (Fig.13). If such curves achieved more significance by addition of corroborating
data, it would be quite possible that a better understanding of the evolution of the brain is attained.
Kaluza’s theory derived the electromagnetic field extending throughout the first three dimensions of a 4D-space. It
was postulated that only a 4+1 space-time structure, (thus with an extra spatial dimension), allows a unity of
relativistic and quantum physical reality including time-symmetric operation and backward causation (Meijer, 2012
and 2015). This also allows causal and tensed-time modalities that are essential for self-consciousness and
reflection (Meijer, 2012 and 2015). Quantum information mechanisms were recently used to model human
consciousness as well as the unconscious in relation to conscious perception (Martin et al, 2013), in which various
modalities of non-locality were discussed. Of note, entanglement and non-locality may not only apply to spatial
separation, but also a temporal one.

It was proposed by Martin et al, 2013, that archetypical information can be stored as quantum information in
appropriate fields and that consciousness may be controlled by quantum entanglement from outside the classical
3+1-D space-time configuration, in an extra 4th spatial dimension An extra spatial dimension is also assumed in
the hypersphere brain model of Tozzi and Peters, (2019). Interestingly, a 5D model theory of life was recently
proposed by Wong et al, 2019, in which the creation of life was conceived as a process of symmetry breaking from
a homogeneous 5D spacetime manifold to a continuous 4D one, which includes the formation of separate toruslike operators (see also Meijer and Wong , 2020; 2021).

11. Human Consciousness Revisited
The brain collects sensory information in addition to resonance of cosmic wave information, by means of brain
wave attractors (Keppler, 2013). Marshall proposed a brain model, that has two interacting systems: a
computational system and a quantum system (Bose-Einstein condensate), perhaps interacting via EEG
waves (Marshall, 1995). In Marshall's hypothesis, the brain contains a Fröhlich-style condensate, and,
whenever the condensate is excited by an electromagnetic field, conscious experience occurs. The brain may
maintain dynamical coherence (i.e., the ability to organize millions of neural processes into the
coherent whole of thought) thanks to such an underlying quantum coherent state: a Bose-Einstein
condensate. According to Fingelkurts (2013): understanding human consciousness requires the
description of the laws of the immediately underlying neural collective phenomena, the nested
hierarchy of spatiotemporal patterns of 3D electromagnetic fields produced by neuronal assemblies. An
analysis has shown that the structure, organization, dynamics, constitutive and causal relationships of
such nested hierarchy of operational architectonics of brain activity are guided by universal physical laws
such as criticality, self-organization, and emergence, (see Fig.14, top). The proposed operational architectonics
framework depicting the mechanisms and dynamics of consciousness allows us to “see” how the phenomenal
(subjective) level is instantiated in the brain. According to this framework, if the operational level of brain
organization (as a whole) is taken away, the phenomenal world ceases to exist. "Spatiotemporal Neuroscience"
conceives the brain and mind in terms of their spatio-temporal dynamics rather than in terms of specific
functions like cognitive, affective, social, cultural, etc. and may have a relation with quantum processes (Northoff
et al., 2019; Fingelkurts et al., 2020).
Quantum coherence (the subtle correlations) represents the entanglement that gets dispersed in the
whole universe through interaction with other systems, amounting effectively to decoherence (Sabbadini,
2021). A hypothesis was proposed by us that the brain is exposed to typical coherent electromagnetic
fields in the form of discrete electromagnetic waves (Meijer, 2014a, 2014b; Meijer and Geesink, 2017,
2019b). It was postulated that consciousness in the whole universe, arises through scale invariant, and
nested toroidal coupling of various energy fields. In the brain of the human species, this takes the form of
the proposed holographic workspace, that collects active information in a ”brain event horizon”,
representing an internal and fully integral model of the self (Meijer and Geesink, 2017). This brain-supervening
workspace is equipped to convert integrated coherent wave energies into attractor type/standing waves,
36

employing soliton and photon resonances that guide the related cortical template to a higher coordination of
reflection and action as well as network synchronicity, as required for conscious states. Electromagnetically seen,
living organisms make use of typical natural coherent quantum resonances, that can be approached by equations
for standing waves. Solitons are multi-dimensionally localized waves that arise from complex dynamical balances
in nonlinear systems and widely exist in physics, chemistry and biology. Solitons are sustained through continuous
energy exchange with the environment, wherein dynamic balances occur between dispersion (or diffraction) and
nonlinearity, as well as gain and loss. Three-dimensional (3D) solitons have been discovered in multimode fibers
(MMF) and spatio-temporal mode-locking MMF lasers, wherein many transverse and longitudinal modes were
simultaneously locked together, resulting in complex structures that arise from spatio-temporal-spectral
interactions (Jing, 2020). In this respect the potential role of solitons (polarons, being electrons dressed in
phonons) were highlighted (Meijer and Geesink, 2016).
Soliton (polaron) waves exhibit remarkable resistance to distortions and noise interference, keeping shape and
velocity even after collision with each other by which they can penetrate animate and typical inanimate materials
without losing their identity. Quantum entangled life conditions and graded states of consciousness in the
universe are scale invariant and are guided by a quantum wave meta-language in a superfluid quantum field that
is instrumental in creating quantum coherent states through pilot wave resonant connectivity, (Meijer et al,
2020). This interacting dynamic EM field is steering life processes through harmonic tuning of fractal structured
water and vibrating macro-molecules, such as DNA and hydrated proteins in the cell, including several cell types
in the human brain (Geesink, 2020a). The concept of harmonic like brain waves was supported by Atasoy et al.
(2018), observing harmonic vibration patterns related to the brain connectome, (Fig.2), in which two imaging
techniques: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were used to create threedimensional oscillation maps of the structure of the brains of a group of individuals.
A proposed 4-D spatial aspect of brain memory was proposed in the fMRI studies of Tozzi and Peters (2016,
2017a, 2017b, Fig.14) demonstrating repetitive modular electric oscillations, that were modeled as a 4-D
hypersphere that produces 3-D antipodal activities on the cortical surfaces. The presence of a field-receptive
resonant workspace, associated with, but not reducible to, our brain, may provide an interpretation framework
for widely reported, but poorly understood conscious states. Tozzi and Peters, (2015), speculated that conscious
moments might be correlated with specific trajectory states in a“Clifford torus” structure. In this framework it has
been proposed that features of EEG brain signals with spectral peaks in preferred bands (alpha, beta gamma EEG
waves) originate from such feature vectors in a 4D Euclidean space.
One example of a recurrent toroidal type of brain activity, might be found in the periodically repeating pattern of
so-called grid cells in the brain. These patterns have therefore been related to a supposed toroidal architecture of
brain wave attractors (McNaughton et al., 2006). The cellular sensors are composed of flexible three-dimensional
structures of proteins, oligonucleotides and elements of the cell skeleton, that mutually communicate through
discrete wave resonances and are sensitive to fluxes of photons, phonons, and related quasi particles such as
polarons and polaritons. These receivers act at the same time as receptors and emitters of quantum information,
and operate as resonant oscillators with specific resonance frequencies, coupled with a natural quantum field
(Rouleau, 2014). A brain model was proposed on the basis of a fractal information theory, derived
from a geometric tone-scale like language that enables the brain to perform intelligent hypercomputing
(Agrawal et al, 2018), and that this aspect has also been approached earlier by toroidal models (Purwins,
2007; Tozzi and Peters, 2016b, 2017c).

37

How does this quantum coherence quality in brain relates to various graded stages of consciousness? The present
results (Fig. 9), show the strongly reduced brain coherence in patients under general anesthesia, that are thereby
brought to an unconscious state. States of differential consciousness indeed correlate with distinct changes in EEG
patterns, allowing the direct monitoring of the conscious/unconscious state during surgical operations. As treated
above, it has been shown in many studies that the loss of consciousness is related to a decrease in long-distance
signaling between various areas in brain, in which especially thalamo-cortical wave circuits seem to be affected. It
is of interest, in that respect, that various general anesthetics interact with tubulin proteins in neuronal
microtubules at various binding sites (Kaira et al., 2022) and somehow “freeze” the longitudinal and transverse
oscillations (see Fig. 9), of signal propagation in the water containing tubes (Li et al., 2019).

The latter authors suggested that the collective micro-tubular matrix could function as a biosensor in brain. It is
indeed possible that electro-active MT structures can activate adjacent neurons by electromagnetic signaling
(Caligiuri and Musha, 2015), due to a process of quantum tunneling that extends the intra-tubular super-radiant
coherent quantum field of photons to extra MT sites. This occurs by amplification of the tunneled evanescent
quantum waves to the outside of the MT cylinder. The generation of bio-photons/phonons is instrumental in highspeed communication within the neuronal system, and this type of information transfer is orders of magnitude
larger than the common neuro-transmission (Meijer et al, 2020). We hold that such a coherent transition process
may play a crucial role in resting states of the brain. In addition it is probably related to short-term memory
formation and permanent updating of and quality control by the supposed holographic mental workspace of the
brain (Meijer and Geesink, 2017), that can be interpreted as representing the actualized individual self,(Fig.14).

4D and cannot be directly observed in our 3D world)
It might plausibly be argued that, healthy minds employ both the classical logic of consciousness and the quantum
primary process logic of the unconscious. Even schizophrenic minds use primary process thinking not only in their
unconscious psychodynamics but also as their dominant conscious operating mode, (Zizzi and Pregnolato, 2012). It
is to be supposed that the interaction with the environment can induce quantum decoherence processes, so that
the occurrence can be predicted of a new logical level, described by classical logic and responsible for the physical
outcomes of mental processes (Tarlaci, 2015; Zizzi and Pregnolato, 2006, 2012, 2013). As treated above, various
studies address the potential relation between graded consciousness states as characterized by EEG monitoring
and the presence of coherent properties in the measured patterns and/or further detailed analysis by
decomposition of the particular wave patterns (Volk et al.,2018). The item of coherence is understood as the
presence of synchronicity of brain activity in those neural parts or networks that currently are claimed to be
instrumental in the generation of conscious states, (Atasoy, 2018; Carhart and Friston, 2019).

Figure 15. Modelling of brain/ mind relation in a 4+1-dimensional space-time framework (4+1 implies 4 spatial
dimensions and one single dimension of time, on the basis of energy trajectories in a nested toroidal geometry. The
opposing forces of Dark energy (diverging force) and Gravity (converging force) as well as discrete wave frequencies
of electromagnetic fields, are instrumental in the generation and compression of individual life information. The
human brain may receive quantum wave information directly derived from the Planck space-time level (left above)
through quantum gravity mediated wave reduction, as well as through resonance with the ZPE field (right above).
Our brain can perceive only 3+1 dimensions with the one-directional arrow of time. The material brain and its 4+1-D
supervening field-receptive mental workspace should be seen as an integral whole, until bodily death of the
organism. The 4th spatial dimension allows individual self-consciousness since an extra degree of freedom is required
for self-observation and reflection, while in the mental context the time dimension is symmetrical, allowing to
integrate past and future- anticipating events. The 4th spatial dimensions is also assumed to accommodate the
bidirectional flow of information between the domains of self-consciousness and universal consciousness. The
bottom-up information flow from the Planck scale, combined with top-down information conjugation from the ZPE
field, constitutes the event horizon of the brain, also integrating gravitational and dark energy related force fields,
supervening the physical brain. Event horizons of the brain and the whole body are depicted in the red ellipse and
circle respectively. Note that the holographic memory workspace, per definition, contains all collective conscious
and unconscious states, enabling its integral brain supervening potential (from Meijer and Geesink, 2017, Meijer et
al., 2020).
We have earlier proposed that the brain is equipped with an integrating workspace for overall quality control and
error correction (Fig. 15, above, Meijer and Geesink, 2017). This was proposed since it is unlikely that the normal
neurotransmission mechanisms are rapid enough to explain the ultra-fast retrieval of memory elements and almost
instantaneous recruitment of information from widely separated parts of the brain. As an alternative the active
involvement of photons/phonons was proposed rendering a versatile communication system that presents multiple
orders of magnitude higher transmission rates. In accordance with the studies of Tozzi and Peters, 2016 a b, 2017,
we postulate the involvement of a 5-dimensional toroidal workspace, (see Fig. 16). Such a workspace is supposed
to contain the integral information of the whole brain in communication with the whole body, and thus including
both conscious and unconscious aspects. This can be envisioned as a manifestation of the holographic principle, in
which each object can be described by a holographic projection around the object, called the “event horizon””,
(Meijer and Geesink, 2017; Meijer et al, 2020).
It can be speculated that (self)-consciousness is largely dependent on the degree of coherence of total brain
information (see later) and that it requires some sort of rapid broadcasting/synchronization function to bind the
several brain structures essential for conscious states. The integral memory workspace is supposed to enable
effective prediction coding though algorithmic simulation of both past and future conditions in a reversed time and
time-forward manner. This concept seems very well compatible with the recently proposed state of “total
simultaneity” as proposed for consciousness by De Wilde, 2016. The holographic event horizon workspace
generates an updated “reference of reference” for quality control of sensory-evoked brain representations. It may
also provide an individual communication modality for inter-person communication and the detection of Psiphenomena such as clairvoyance and synchronicity (Meijer et al, 2020). The integral memory feature may also
form the basis for the known detailed Life- panorama’s know from reported Near Death Experiences (NDE), in
addition to broadly described effects of psycho-mimetic drugs that promote visual hallucinations and feelings of
cosmic wholeness.

40

A field-like quantum organization was proposed by several authors (Amoroso, 2016, Sarfatti, 2020 McFadden,
2020, Hameroff and Penrose,2014, Meijer et al.,2020). We have earlier identified a potential mechanism for longrange communication by acoustic phonons in brain, as well as in the communication in relation with environment
and information force fields such as zero-point energy field (see Meijer, 2019;2020), see also Keppler, 2018).
Receiving of external wave information in brain may be based on reception by hydronium-type of proton antenna’s
in brain water compartments. (Meijer et al., 2020), in which electron/phonon (polaron quasi-particles) were
supposed to represent the information carriers (Meijer and Ivaldi, 2022). Other recent studies confirm the
important influence of brain wave coherence in health and disease, (Meijer and Geesink, 2017; Meijer et al 2020;
2021abc).

In Table 4, recent studies on the very nature of consciousness are listed, that touch upon the involvement of
quantum physics in brain function. For an transparent overview of more classical consciousness theories, the
reader is advised to study the recent review of Sett and Bayne, 2022, that only mentions but did not treat or even
discusses the theory of Hameroff and Penrose. Quite surprising is that these authors, also in general, do not
mention the recent progress in Quantum Biology and Quantum Holography, nor the potential mechanisms of
photon/phonon mediated brain communication, let alone the numerous cosmic approaches to consciousness (for
the latter see the solid review of Wabeh et al,2022).
In addition, we earlier found that energy gaps of various superconductor materials also show this frequency power
distribution (Geesink and Meijer, 2019a), implying that superconductive properties can be improved and shifted to
higher temperature ranges by EMF lasing, using these discrete frequencies. Recently, we revealed the same
frequency patterns in a set experimentally measured ZPE wave frequencies (Meijer, 2021), as well as in the
recently reported gravity waves that are detected for the first time in the past years (see Meijer and Geesink,
2022).
What could be the relation between this spectrum of physical phenomena and the subject of the present paper on
brain function? Here we report on the remarkable congruence with the vibratory patterns of neuronal microtubular
structures, that are supposed to be essential for the creation of conscious states by an orchestrated wave reduction
through alignment to gravity fluctuations at the Planck level (Hameroff and Penrose, 2015). Since the spiral microtubular tubulin protein chains contain a core of coherently structured water domains, the set of ZPE guided
frequencies detected by us in water ( Geesink, Jerman and Meijer,2020), may functionally link these processes
since ZPE oscillations can reflect those at the Planck scale (Meijer, 2022). The overall coupling with brain function
becomes clear realizing that cerebrospinal water compartments in the brain probably represent a domain with
freely moving hydronium (H2O- proton) units, that can be considered as EMF antenna’s for internal and external
EMF vibrations(Meijer et al, 2020). This brings all the features for an efficient and guided brain function together:
- ultra-rapid information transfer through superconductive flow of photon/phonon activity, - potential for fieldreceptive signal conduction, the required entanglement of distant brain areas (Poznanski, 2020), the gravity
connection as suggested by Hameroff and Penrose, 2015, as confirmed in the group of Bandyopadhyai,2013, - as
well as the need for quality control and a brain reference domain with an updated individual memory information
register (see above and Fig.16).
The latter total construction can only be envisioned if a holographic connection modality is operable in the whole
organism, in which each part of the hologram contains the information of the whole. This enables the simulation of
present and future states instrumental as a ”reference of reference”. This, in turn could guide subtle brain
processes that make up some poorly understood, but firmly established, Psi phenomena such as clairvoyance,
intuition and synchronicity. The holographic principle includes an event horizon in which the entire information
that describes an entity, is projected on a hyperspherIcal domain that surrounds this object. This can even be true
for individual cells, in which for example complex protein communication networks are functioning, requiring a
precise 3D folding of each of the participating proteins, realizing that for each individual protein molecule, millions
of possible configurations are possible (Meijer ad Geesink, 2018b and Melkick and Meijer, 2018).
Such a holographic and field receptive workspace, associated with the brain could also function as a means of
interconnections of human individuals that are increasingly reported. In general, it would provide the basis for the
cosmic relation and universal consciousness of which we all are participating ( Kastrup, 2018; Meijer and Raggett,
2014; Meijer, 2019). Such a brain supervening modality is assumed directly in various brain/consciousness models,
42

as proposed by Amoroso, Sarfatti, Fingelkurz, De Wilde, Hameroff, Ho, Irwin, Keppler,Wahbeh, Wong, and if fact
implied in many of the other models listed in Table 3, and actually even in the Global /Neuronal Workspace models
of Baars and Dehaene (see Mashour, 2022).
In the present paper, we hypothesize that brain functions are embedded in a imperceptible fourth spatial
dimension, its presence empirically assessed using neuro-imaging with fMRI series, (see section 10). Indeed, there
is a typical feature that reveals the existence of such a functional hypersphere: the simultaneous activation of areas
opposite each other on the 3D cortical surface, (Tozzi an Peters, 2020, Fig. 14, D to G), substantiated that brain
activity takes place on a closed, donut-like trajectory. Thereby, according to these authors, helping to solve longstanding mysteries concerning our psychological activities, such as mind-wandering, memory retrieval,
consciousness and dreaming states.
Although this selected spectrum of studies listed in Table 3, (albeit not complete), propose quite different
concepts, there are certainly a number of common aspects that are frequently expressed in the listed papers, that
support our model:

12. Discussion on the Application of the Acoustic Quantum Code Model to EEG
Monitoring in Healthy and Psychiatric Individuals
More generally seen, coherence describes the degree of frequency correlation between physical properties of
multiple waves or wave packets in which global quantum coherence can be defined as the total of coherent
frequency states among all recorded states. If all waves exhibit the defined coherent values, the global coherence
will be 1.0 and, consequently, if all waves show decoherent values, this parameter is 0.0. It is assumed by us that
the same quantum principle is valid for electromagnetic waves in brain. A combined coherence/decoherence
theory was formulated on the basis of bioinformatics and quantum mechanics. Two quantum wave equations of
coherence and decoherence are proposed, that can be considered as a next step of the Chern-Simons theory,
initially conceived from the path integral of a 2-3 theory and later the 1-2-3 theory. Such a mathematical approach
43

offers a way in which toroidal geometry can be applied to characterize quantum correlations, making use of Chern
numbers, (Geesink, 2021, Meijer and Geesink, 2022)
EEG- and MEG studies of healthy and diseased individuals have been analyzed here, that show frequency patterns,
that are evidently related to healthy and unhealthy conditions in our bio-information model. It can be concluded
that there is a good fit between the oscillatory eigenmodes of the proposed quantum model and the treated
examples of EEG measurements in practice. It was demonstrated that EEG oscillations and MEG signals which
constituted brain were characteristic for different groups of conditions that may be correlated with typical
oscillation patterns that reflect functional significance. Of note, there is also a good fit with the proposed
oscillatory eigenmodes by Fingelkurts (2006, 2020), and there is a reasonable fit between the proposed quantum
code model and the oscillatory eigenmodes and modes mentioned in the paper of Quinn et al., (2020).
One study deals with the spatial topography of the brain, and there appeared to be a reasonable fit with the model
of the generalized cross-frequency decomposition interactions in EEG/MEG recordings (GCFD algorithm) of Volk et
al., (2018). The main difference between the models of Volk et al, 2018 and our proposed quantum model is that
the first model is fully harmonic, whereas the second is a semi-harmonic model. The proposed quantum code
model assumes that all distributed energies (frequencies) can be described by ratios of 1:2, and close
approximations of 2:3 where a small adaptation is required of the well-known Pythagorean tuning (see section 2).
Volk et al found the strongest synchronous components for p : q equal to 2 : 1 and 2 : 3 and the base frequencies
from the alpha frequency range (8–12 Hz). For example, the maximum PLV for p : q = 2 : 3 could have been attained
at the base frequency 9.5 Hz which would mean that the most 2 : 3-synchronized components are at 19 Hz and 28.5
Hz. These frequencies and the flickering frequencies 5.45, 8.57, 12, 15 Hz including the proposed integer
frequencies 6, 9, 12, 15 Hz, precisely fit with our proposed quantum model (see the frequency values of the
quantum informational code in our database). This demonstrates that the AQCC algorithm can be reasonably
utilized for the investigation of such complex cross-frequency interactions. On the other hand, the proposed
quantum algorithm shows cross-frequency interactions as well as discrete (fixed) frequency values and recognizes
healthy versus unhealthy frequency patterns. Volk et al., (2018) mention: In EEG experiments not a particularly
strong correlation could be found between pattern similarity and the strength of cross-frequency phase synchrony.
This in turn indicates that the extracted cross-frequency interactions are unlikely to be due to the presence of
harmonic conditions alone, since in that case a correlation between the pattern similarity and PLV values would be
stronger.

13. Final Conclusions and Perspectives for the Proposed Brain Model. The Graded Loss of
Coherence in EEG in Mental Disorders and its Relation with Consciousness
An electromagnetic mechanism, steering a phase-synchronisation on the basis of the degree of coherence in the
the spectral lines of EEG and MEG was shown in the present study. This analysis is based upon a derived Quantum
Code equation of coherence: En = ħ ωref 2q 3m , that was earlier substantiated and reported in a series of our papers
from 2016- 2022. In this framework we analyzed in total more than 1200 different bio-medical/biophysics studies
revealing the coherence/decoherence distribution patterns of EMF frequencies, both in animate and inanimate
systems, and in the present paper applied for EEG recorded brain waves. The overall coherent spatiotemporal
brain rhythms seem to render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective by activating neuronal cell
groups that are engaged in rhythmic synchronization of brain-wide electric activity. Highly coherent EEG peaks
reflect synchronized neuronal network oscillations, whereas low coherence values may rather indicate chaotic
44

brain activity of local networks and/or more independently operating neuro-modular populations. We interpret
the participating Eigen-modes in brain function as oscillatory modes, that govern the spatial topography and
resonance structure of brain cells and their networks that show a similarity with the proposed spatio-spectral
Eigen-modes for brainwaves reported by Quinn et al., 2020 and Volk et al. 2018.
The published spectra of EEG and MEG-frequencies, analyzed by us, can be differentiated in discrete quantum
coherent and decoherent frequency spectra in the recorded brain waves: coherent patterns are defined as
promoting healthy conditions, whereas, on the contrary, decoherent patterns are underlying unhealthy states. It
was shown that all discrete frequencies of the analysed EEG- and MEG-measurements can therefore be positioned
in a framework of spatio-spectral Eigen-modes and precisely described by the two proposed quantum equations of
coherence and decoherence, mentioned above. The EEG- and MEG studies of healthy persons show a global
quantum coherence of 0.90-1.00. Unhealthy conditions show a decrease of coherence, and thus, at the same time,
an increase of decoherent peak values. ADHD subjects show a decrease of coherence from 1.0 to 0.83. During
epileptic seizure, the coherence of participants is reduced from 0.94 to 0.75. Depressed patients have a lower
coherence than healthy persons, respectively 0.77 - 0.88. Patients with severe psychiatric disorders show a much
lower coherence of about 0.59. Locked-in patients have a global brain coherence of 0.71 and participants during
anaesthesia show a much lower level of 0.25. Nearly all of the published spatio-spectra EEG activity peaks could be
classified according to the Eigen-modes described by the Acoustic Quantum Code algorithm and are involved over
a broad range of EEG frequencies in our brain. We hope that, on this basis, in the near future, a new biomarker for
brain function in health and disease can be developed with diagnostic capabilities by more detailed analysis of EEG
patterns with regard to the degree of coherent discrete frequencies defined by our algorithm..
With regard to the clinical application of this knowledge, potential beneficial effects can be applied by making use
of rTMS at typical frequencies. We concluded that the applied frequencies in current therapeutic practise strikingly
match with the proposed algorithm of coherence. Applied typical frequencies could also be related to reported
antidepressant effects and generally fit with the proposed eigenstates (Eigen-frequencies) described by the present
equation of coherence. These observations may highlight a quantum bridge between physics and biology in brain
function and, according to our earlier studies (Meijer and Geesink, 2017), may imply a toroidal geometry in te
electromagnetic organization of brain activity (see also Tozzi and Peters, 2015) and confirm a harmonic pattern of
brain wave activity (see also Fig. 2 and Atasoy et al., 2017).
There is also evidence of an association between biological macromolecules driven by electromagnetic coherent
forces/waves in vitro, and energy sources to maintain the molecules in these ordered states: possible candidates
are: adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) as a universal biological fuel, ionic assemblies such as those used to drive ATP
synthesis, ionic collisions, and water molecules. Interestingly there is a relation with the Eigen-frequencies of ATP:
an example is the 0.42 eV energy, released under hydrolysis of ATP molecule, as studied by Davydov (1973;1977)
and Pang (2001, 2016). A hypothesis is that this energy is transferred along the alfa-helical protein molecules, while
the oscillation energy of the C = O moieties of the peptide groups (amide-I vibration) is at 0.21 eV or 1665 cm-1,
which is in resonance with the 0.42 eV of the ATP process. Interestingly, the energy released under hydrolysis of
ATP molecule, the oscillation energy of the C = O of the peptide groups and the different bending modes of
interfacial water molecules fit precisely with the calculated coherent frequencies of the proposed quantum
equation of coherence, respectively: 0.415 eV, 0.2073 eV and 1660-1693 cm-1. Next to this water molecules play a
role: A meta-analysis of about 700 measured frequencies of pure water shows that 192 subsequent first and
second derivatives of spectral frequency curves of water molecules can be precisely positioned at the proposed

45

lines of the calculated pattern of coherent eigenfrequencies with an error of 0.45% and statistical significance of p <
0.02 (Geesink et al., 2020).
A number of observations in the present study support our hypothesis of disturbed brain coherence in mental
disorders:

A significant decrease in coherent peak values in EEG recordings seems to correlate with the assumed severity
of mental disorders as classified in current psychiatry
Micro-tubular oscillations in brain tissues display the distinct EMF frequencies of our quantum code algorithm
Laser frequencies used in rTMS in clinical therapeutic practice fully fit the frequency values of our model
Preliminary results, on measured EMF frequencies, in vitro: in Brain slices/tissues, brain gland tissues and DNA,
also demonstrate the coherent/decoherent discrete frequency values as defined by the present Quantum code
model published in Geesink, 2022 b).

Figure 16: Current theories of Consciousness such as First-- and Higher-Order modalities (right below), the Global
Workspace Theory of Baars et al., 2021 (left above), and the Integrated Information Theory of Tononi et al.,2015,
that are both related to the 5D Event Horizon workspace theory of Meijer et al, 2020 (left below), in which the
postulated workspace provides an integral and updates information domain for past, present and future aspects of
brain memory. This enables optimal guiding to coherent brain function, being associated with but only partly
reducible to the brain, but representing a projection of the 4D brain in a 5D holographic workspace. As mentioned
above, this integral holographic memory workspace contains both the aspects of conscious states and unconscious
states, in contrast to most of the brain models proposed by others.
46

General Conclusion: The overall results show the presence of an informational quantum code in brain function,
through a direct relation with the Eigen frequencies of toroidal ordered wave patterns in whole brain, and/or
essential parts of the brain such as glands and microtubules. This probably represents a molecular code-script,
which supplies information to realize biological order in life cells and substantiates a collective “Bose-Einstein type”
of oscillation behaviour. A potential EEG-based biomarker can therefore be tentatively proposed, and may
hopefully show some diagnostic capability to classify nature/severity of unhealthy mental conditions. Yet, for this
purpose many more dedicated clinical EEG studies should be set up to substantiate this claim. The present results
on coherence in brain EMF activity, may also have crucial implications for psychotherapy, and in particular for
measures to promote feelings of wholeness in the treatment of psychiatric patients to day. These include various
modalities of meditation, healing by music, (Meijer et al, 2020), as well as the current treatment with mindperturbing hallucinogenic or psychedelic substances (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019). The latter seem to work by
relaxing the precision weighing of overestimated priors in psychiatry patients, that in our view, among many other
genetic or environmental factors, are related to dominant decoherence processes that may negatively influence
healthy brain function in related mental disorders. It is of major interest that a differential loss of coherent wave
activity in brain may, in principle, be improved by applying external (trans-cranial) or internally placed EM radiating
probes, that can potentially shift the coherence/decoherence balance of EMF brain activity to more healthy
conditions.
We also hold that coherence of collective brain waves, as quantified by our Acoustic Quantum Code algorithm
frequencies, is indicative for graded states of brain function in which the stochastic nature of brain activity can be
overcome, by acoustic tuning to functional coherent states. This likely occurs by increasing the whole-brain
connectivity through an elevated wave synchronization of various brain centres, using long range guiding of neural
networks and/or task/orientated brain modules. We emphasize here again that the usual definition of
coherent/decoherent, as beneficial and detrimental respectively, is too simple. In section 8, we showed that
decoherent conditions, in an interplay with coherent ones, can be essential for efficient quantum flux (example
photosynthesis) and can even promote of entanglement (see Fig. 11). In this respect the coherent/decoherent
states were described as a reversible poised domain in equilibrium (Kauffman, 2010). In our microtubule study, also
decoherent wave modes were detected, probably in relation to their functional structure. Since the EEG peak
patterns are rather a collective registration of underlying and superposed harmonic rythms, their altered degree of
coherence in mental disorders can be interpreted as a perturbation of the coherent/decoherene balance. But the
latter leaves open potential changes in decoherence induced entanglement. In a recent study (Wellnitz et al.,
2022), it was shown that disorder can enhance vibrational entanglement of polariton states. Since
phonons/photons and related quasi particles likely play a role in brain function, an increased entanglement could
be expressed in various dreaming states or feelings of wholeness known from deep mental meditation exercise or
use of psychomimetic drugs, that have been shown to induce cosmic and other Psi experiences, mentioned above.
In addition, we submit that apart from the harmonic type of brain activity frequencies, there is a second
mathematically based power spectrum that seems to be rather essential for proper wave expression and
propagation in brain function: The Golden mean, phi-based “Fibonacci series”. This wave behavior can be
envisioned as proper tone separation in more musical terms, essential for cross-frequency atonement and
prevention of non-productive wave interactions/interference. This implies that mental disorders, in principle, can
also arise from a deficient Golden Mean guided brainwave organization and invites the question if such conditions
could be treated by using external lasing with dedicated (golden spiral-like) EMF radiation modes.

47

With regard to (self)consciousness, in particular entanglement at the more micro-quantum level may be required. It
is proposed in the present paper that a top/down supervening influence can be achieved by employing a dedicated
information workspace, that according to holographic principles, contains all the integrated life information of the
individual brain (Meijer and Geesink, 2017; Meijer et al., 2020). We submit that such a memory databank is
associated with the brain in an extra spatial dimension and thus a 5D space/time, as it is proposed in current
physics and quantum mechanics. This, therefore, may also explain the long range resonance process of the Global
and Neuronal Workspace Theory (see Mashour et al, 2020), in more detail and also explains the supposed
integration of meaningful information as hypothesized in the Integrated Information Theory, see Fig 16, above.
Our consciousness model, (Fig.15 and 16), does not negate the classic (neurohumoral) theory, ( to be seen as the
standard model of neurology), but should be seen as a necessary mechanistic addition that enables a much more
rapid signal transmission in brain, being instrumented by photo-phonon type of data communication, as given by
our concept of Acoustic Quantum Code of Resonant Coherence. The latter represents a fractal set of discrete.
electromagnetic frequencies and as treated before, we assume an essential role of this harmonic system in the
creation of first life (Meijer et al, 2020), as well as in the primordial events that preceded the very creation of our
universe. These processes, as driven by symmetry breaking and generation of a toroidal geometry (Meijer and
Wong, 2021; 2022), were conceived to also determine the further evolution of our world (Meijer, 2022; Meijer and
Ivaldi, 2022), in which mankind participates in the reconstruction of a self/learning Universe. Our integral
holographic consciousness model integrates conscious and non-conscious conditions and invites further studies
into the geometric relation of the observed and hidden processes that are instrumental in the fabric of our reality.
