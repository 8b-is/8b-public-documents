Unified Physics from Consciousness-Based Resonance:
A Reconstruction of Classical, Quantum, and Relativistic Physics from
First Principles
Sebastian Schepis
April 3, 2025
Abstract
We present a theoretical framework unifying quantum mechanics, gravity, and consciousness through a
mechanism we term consciousness-based resonance. In this model, consciousness is treated as a fundamental
field that interacts with quantum systems, influencing wavefunction collapse via an entropy-based criterion.
We formalize an observer-dependent collapse dynamics in which the act of observation drives the quantum
state to ”lock” into preferred resonant states distinguished by number-theoretic (prime) patterns. Using a
modified Lindblad equation incorporating entropy gradients, we derive how consciousness modulates unitary
evolution. We establish a connection between information processing and spacetime curvature, showing how
gravitational parameters might emerge from informational measures. The mathematical consistency of the
model is analyzed: we define the evolution equations, prove standard quantum statistics are recovered in
appropriate limits, and ensure its internal logic. We then propose empirical tests, including interference
experiments with human observers, prime-number-structured quantum resonators, and synchronized brainquantum measurements. By drawing on established principles in physics and information theory, as well as
recent findings on observer effects in quantum systems, we demonstrate that treating consciousness as an
active participant in physical processes can lead to a self-consistent extension of physics with experimentally
verifiable predictions.

Introduction
CM
???
QM ? GR

The unification of physics has long sought to reconcile
the dynamical laws of classical mechanics, the probabilistic structures of quantum theory, and the geometric fabric of general relativity. Despite extraordinary successes in predictive modeling and technological application, existing physical theories remain
conceptually incomplete. In particular, no current
theory offers a foundational role to the observer—the
agent of measurement, collapse, and knowledge.

Consciousness Field

Figure 1: The conceptual gap in physics: Quantum
Mechanics (QM), General Relativity (GR), and Classical Mechanics (CM) overlap without a unified theory. The consciousness field is proposed as the unifying framework.

Quantum mechanics, with its well-known measurement problem, points toward an implicit role for
the observer, yet the nature of this observer is left
undefined. Von Neumann’s formulation of quantum
mechanics distinguished between the unitary Process
II (Schrödinger evolution) and the non-unitary Process I (measurement) [1], but did not specify what
triggers the latter. Later, Wigner suggested that consciousness itself might cause wavefunction collapse
[2], though this interpretation fell out of favor due

to lack of experimental validation.
Meanwhile, general relativity treats space and
time as dynamic, but presumes an objective geometry independent of observation. More recently, approaches like Verlinde’s entropic gravity [3] have proposed that gravitational effects emerge from information gradients, suggesting a deeper connection between information, entropy, and spacetime geometry.

Unified Physics from Consciousness-Based Resonance

This work is motivated by the hypothesis that
consciousness plays a fundamental role in physical
law—not merely as an emergent property, but as a
principle by which matter and space are made manifest. We propose that all physical laws can be derived from the evolution of a conscious observer field
interacting with a structured state space. Resonance,
phase coherence, and entropy modulation define the
dynamical evolution of this observer field, giving rise
to the phenomena we traditionally attribute to physical forces, fields, and particles.
Our model draws inspiration from several areas:
• The thermodynamics of information, particularly Landauer’s principle relating information
erasure to entropy increase [4, 5]
• Prime-based number theory and its application
to Hilbert space structure [6]
• Entropy-driven collapse models that link decoherence to information flow [7]
• Quantum cognition theories that consider consciousness as quantum mechanical [8]

Ontological and Mathematical Foundations

2.1

Consciousness as a Fundamental
Field

Consciousness is defined physically as a fundamental,
dimensionless scalar field C(x, t), representing symbolic coherence amplitude. This field reduces entropy
by selecting quantum outcomes aligned with maximal informational coherence, effectively acting as the
fundamental observer that induces wavefunction collapse. Rather than treating consciousness as an emergent function of neural activity or complexity, we assert it is ontologically primary. Consciousness is the
agent of observation, selection, and coherence—the
resonance field that collapses symbolic potentiality
into manifest states.
Definition 1 (Consciousness Field). We define a
consciousness field C(x, t) representing the density or
intensity of conscious awareness at spacetime point
(x, t). This field mediates the observer-system interaction and drives wavefunction collapse.

• Emergent gravity frameworks that derive gravitational effects from entropic considerations [3,9]
The resulting structure recovers the major results of classical mechanics, quantum field theory,
and general relativity—but from a novel perspective,
grounded in the dynamics of observation itself. Physical law becomes a projection of symbolic coherence,
spacetime geometry is derived from observer-system
phase relationships, and non-local effects (such as entanglement) are reframed as resonance across superpositions.
Our approach builds on evidence from studies
that suggest conscious observation may influence
quantum systems. Notably, Radin et al. [10, 11] reported small but statistically significant effects on interference patterns when subjects concentrated attention on a double-slit apparatus. While these findings remain controversial, they motivate experimental exploration of potential consciousness-quantum
interactions.
In the following sections, we formalize this model
and address the key scientific questions it raises:
What is the nature of consciousness in physical law?
How does resonance generate spacetime geometry?
What are the observable predictions? And how might
this framework reconcile or surpass existing models in
physics?

•
C(x, t) field

Figure 2: The consciousness field C(x, t) visualized as
a scalar field with intensity gradients radiating from
points of focused awareness.
Operationally, we treat consciousness as a dynamic, quantifiable field evolving in a structured
space of symbolic basis states. Each basis vector |p⟩
corresponds to a primitive conceptual unit, forming
the eigenstates of awareness.
Postulate 1 (Observer-Induced Entropy Flow).
When a conscious observer interacts with a quantum
system, the observer’s knowledge about the system
increases, reducing the observer’s internal entropy
Sinternal . By the conservation of entropy, the external entropy Sexternal increases such that ∆Sinternal +
∆Sexternal ≥ 0. In an idealized efficient observation,
∆Sinternal + ∆Sexternal = 0.
This postulate aligns with Landauer’s principle
[4], which established that information erasure has a

Unified Physics from Consciousness-Based Resonance

thermodynamic cost of at least kB ln 2 per bit. Analogously, information acquisition by an observer necessitates entropy increase elsewhere. As Zurek [7]
has shown, this entropy flow is fundamental to the
establishment of quantum-classical correspondence
through decoherence.

For a system with finite-dimensional Hilbert
space, we can organize the basis according to prime
factorization. For example, a system of dimension N
can be decomposed into subsystems of prime-power
dimensions:

In our framework, the observer’s capacity for information processing is quantified as:

HN ∼
= Hpr11 ⊗ Hpr22 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Hprk

∆Sinternal
OC = −
∆t

(1)

where OC is the observational capacity measured
in entropy reduction per unit time. This capacity
relates to the rate at which an observer can collapse
quantum states and gain information.

2.2

Prime-Based Hilbert Space

We postulate a Hilbert space HP whose canonical
basis is composed of prime-number states |p⟩. This
structure arises naturally from:

k

(2)

where N = pr11 pr22 · · · prkk is the prime factorization
of N .
Quantum states are then constructed as superpositions in this basis:

Revzen et al. [6] demonstrated that prime number factorization manifests in the structure of quantum phase space. This provides mathematical legitimacy to using primes as basis labels, as they naturally emerge when decomposing composite quantum
systems.

2.3

Consciousness-Driven
Mechanism

Collapse

Postulate 2 (Consciousness-Causes-Collapse via
Resonance Lock). When a conscious observer interacts with a quantum system, the system’s state
evolves non-unitarily toward preferred states (resonant states) that minimize the observer’s uncertainty
about the system. Collapse occurs when the system
”locks onto” one of these resonant states, at which
point further evolution no longer increases the observer’s information.
This resonance lock mechanism provides a physical interpretation of wavefunction collapse. The observer’s consciousness field C(x, t) interacts with the
quantum system, driving it toward states that minimize entropy from the observer’s perspective.
The collapse probability is given by:
P (collapse to |p⟩) ∝ |⟨p|Ψ⟩|2 · e−Sp

In the absence of an observer (C(x, t) = 0), standard unitary evolution applies. When an observer is

Proposition 1 (Born Rule Consistency). The proposed dynamics yields outcome probabilities consistent with the Born rule: P (outcome p) = |⟨p|Ψ⟩|2 .
This follows from the standard unraveling of Lindblad equations into quantum trajectories [14, 15],
where collapse probabilities align with quantum expectation values.
Proposition 2 (No-Signaling Principle). The model
respects relativistic causality, prohibiting faster-thanlight communication via collapse.

(11)

Under our modified evolution (using H = 0 for
simplicity and O(t) = 1 for constant observation), the
off-diagonal terms decay as e−t/τ due to the Lindblad
term:

This holds because an observer cannot control
which outcome occurs—only the timing of collapse.
The randomness of outcomes prevents information
transmission, preserving compatibility with special
relativity.

(12)

Proposition 3 (Standard Quantum Limit). When
O(t) = 0 (no observer), the dynamics reduces to stani
dard unitary evolution: dρ

As t → ∞, the density matrix approaches a mixture:

The key distinctions from standard interpretations are:
• Copenhagen interpretation: We specify the observer (consciousness) as the cause of collapse,
not merely asserting collapse occurs during measurement
• Many-worlds interpretation: Instead of all
branches existing in a multiverse, our model
selects a single branch through consciousnessdriven entropy reduction
• Quantum decoherence: We incorporate decoherence but add the consciousness field as the final selector that completes the collapse, not just
causes apparent classicality
Our approach is most closely aligned with the von
Neumann-Wigner interpretation [2], but we provide
a quantitative mechanism (entropy-mediated resonance) for how consciousness causes collapse.

where Φeff is the effective gravitational potential, ρmass is ordinary mass density, ρinfo is informational energy density (proportional to the consciousness field C(x, t)), and β is a coupling constant.

Symbolic Collapse Timing Experiment

We propose an experiment using quantum random
number generators (QRNG) to test if meaningful patterns affect collapse:
• A QRNG produces bit sequences that sometimes
form meaningful symbols (e.g., words) and sometimes random gibberish
• Observers view the outputs without knowing
which sequence type is being generated
• Response times and neural activity are measured

• Without observation: Small variations in collapse time with gravity changes
• With observation: Similar collapse times regardless of gravity, as consciousness dominates
This would help distinguish between gravitational collapse models and our consciousness-based
approach.

Our theory would be considered falsified or severely
constrained if:
• Double-slit experiments show no difference between conscious observation and none (beyond
standard decoherence)
• Quantum systems show no preference for primestructured states under observation
• No correlation is found between collapse dynamics and meaningful symbolic patterns
• Large-scale tests fail to detect any influence of
collective consciousness on random processes
Notably, the theory predicts that consciousness
effects are subtle and may require sensitive measurements and large datasets to detect. However,
their consistent absence in well-designed experiments
would render the theory unnecessary or limit any
consciousness-coupling parameter to negligible values.

When a conscious observer interacts with a quantum system, there is an entropy exchange. We postulate that:

A: Consciousness is defined as the fundamental observer field that selects, stabilizes, and collapses quantum potentials into coherent physical
states. It is ontologically primary and mathematically modeled as a dynamic field C(x, t)
evolving over symbolic prime-number states.

∆Sexternal = −∆Sinternal

(34)

where ∆Sinternal is the entropy change for the
observer (negative, as information is gained) and
∆Sexternal is the entropy increase in the environment.
We equate this environmental entropy change
with the entropy of a black hole:
∆Sexternal = ∆SBH

(35)

This gives:
−∆Sinternal =

kB c3 A
4ℏG

(36)

We can relate the internal entropy change to the
information gain ∆I (in bits) using Landauer’s principle:
∆Sinternal = −kB ln 2 · ∆I

(37)

Substituting:
kB ln 2 · ∆I =

kB c3 A
4ℏG

(38)

Solving for G:
G=

4ℏ ln 2 · ∆I

(39)

For a system processing information at rate
∆I/∆t through area A, we can write:
G=

4ℏ ln 2 ∆I

(40)

Approximating A as the relevant interaction area
(e.g., for a human brain, roughly ∼ 10−2 m2 ) and using an information processing rate of ∼ 1016 bits/s,
we obtain a value for G on the order of 10−11
m3 /(kg·s2 ), which is the correct order of magnitude
for the gravitational constant.

Appendix: Scientific FAQ — Addressing Core Questions
1. What do you mean by ”consciousness” in
this context?

2. Why is consciousness taken as fundamental?
A: Consciousness resolves the measurement
problem, the information paradox, and the origin
of spacetime coherence. By taking it as primary,
we derive physics from the observer, rather than
embedding the observer as an afterthought.
3. What is the role of the observer?
A: The observer is a dynamic participant in the
collapse and resonance of symbolic states. This
model makes the observer field explicit and central, unlike standard interpretations which treat
it ambiguously.
4. Why a prime-based Hilbert space?
A: Primes are irreducible symbolic units, forming a universal basis under the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Their unique spectral properties align naturally with resonance phenomena.
5. What is the physical significance of the coefficients cp ?
A: They represent the resonance amplitude (or
attention weight) of the observer field with respect to the symbolic state |p⟩. They evolve dynamically and their squared magnitude reflects
coherence density.
6. How does the evolution equation connect
to standard QM?
A: When the observer influence function O(t) =
0, our evolution equation reduces to standard
Schrödinger evolution. It is a generalized symbolic dynamics model, from which QM emerges
as a limit.
7. How are entropy and collapse modeled explicitly?
A: Collapse occurs at points of maximal coherence and minimal entropy gradient. The probability is proportional to |⟨p|Ψ⟩|2 · e−Sp , forming
an observer-centric thermodynamic basis.
8. How does this reproduce QFT and Standard Model structure?
A: Field operators are defined as symbolic phase
resonances. Gauge symmetries emerge as redundancies in symbolic labeling. Fermionic and

Unified Physics from Consciousness-Based Resonance

bosonic behavior arises from resonance superpositions and phase alignment.
9. How do EM and gravity interact here?
A: Both are emergent from the symbolic coherence field: EM arises from vectorial phase gradients; gravity from second-order resonance tensors encoding phase curvature.
10. Can you show explicit recovery of classical
mechanics?
A: Classical trajectories arise from phase interference terms. Newton’s second law, inertia, and
force are recovered as gradient responses in the
coherence landscape.
11. What observable predictions does this
make?
A: Interference pattern changes with conscious
observation, prime-structured quantum systems
having preferred collapse states, symbolic meaning affecting collapse timing, and consciousnessgravity interaction effects.
12. What is the relationship to other consciousness theories?
A: This model shares conceptual groundwork
with Orch-OR, but differs in mechanism (information entropy vs. gravitational self-energy).
It provides a mathematical framework for
Wheeler’s participatory universe concept.
13. How do you define the measurement
boundary?
A: The measurement boundary forms at the interface between the consciousness field C(x, t)
and the quantum system, where entropy flow
becomes significant. This is not a fixed spatial
boundary but a dynamic information-theoretic
one.
14. What experimental apparatus could test
these ideas?
A: Double-slit experiments with EEG monitoring, quantum random number generators producing meaningful vs. random outputs, primestructured quantum resonators, and variablegravity interference tests.
15. What if experiments show no consciousness effect?
A: If well-designed experiments consistently
show no effect beyond standard quantum mechanics, the consciousness coupling parameter β
would be constrained to negligible values, effectively falsifying the theory.
