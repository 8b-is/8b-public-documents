THE QUANTUM MIND *

When did consciousness arise? Basically there are three possibilities for the
origin of consciousness in the universe. Number one, which is the most popular
I would say amongst scientists, certainly, consciousness emerged as a property
of biological complexity at some point during the course of evolution. And we
can argue about when.
Number two is a more religious view that consciousness has been in the
universe all along, for example, as the ground of being or God as suggested by
spiritual approaches, and/or in the fine structure of spacetime geometry. Now,
I will argue that that last clause in the fine structure of spacetime geometry is
more or less equivalent to the ground of being or God to some extent as suggested
by spiritual approaches.
The third is a little bit different from number two in that sense that the
precursor of consciousness has been in the universe all along with consciousness
emerging during evolution as quantum biomolecular processes in the brain
connecting to the fine structure of spacetime geometry. So number three is kind
of a combination of one and two. Now let’s consider where and when.
This allows me to walk around a little bit. Here are a number of possibilities.
The earth formed about four and a half billion years ago and life started about
three and a half billion years ago, and for a long time not much happened. And
then eukaryotic cells developed, if you believe Lynn Margulis with the symbiotic
merger of spirochetes with cytoskeletal structures in with prokaryotes, but still
not much happened until about 540 million years ago. And then in a fairly brief
10 million years, all the animal phyla evolved rather quickly.
This is known as the Cambrian evolutionary explosion. I wrote a paper
suggesting that consciousness emerged here in the Cambrian evolutionary
explosion where the organisms were fairly simple organisms at the beginning
and then wound up with mammals by the end of the 10 million years. Now,
some of these creatures are still around. And give us, for example, this urchin
over here is still around in the form of Actinosphaerium, and I happen to know
about this organism. It’s got these oxoniums coming out, which are sort of
precursors of neurons, and if you cut a cross-section of them, you’ll see that they
are these double spirals of microtubules. Each of these circles is a microtubule
on end, and this whole thing is made of polymerised microtubules.
If you anaesthetise this creature with anaesthetic, the microtubules
depolymerise. And that gave rise to a theory in 1968 that anaesthesia worked by

depolymerising microtubules, although it turned out to require quite a bit more
to depolymerise than it does to cause anaesthesia. But it does show that
microtubules are sensitive to anaesthesia. Now, the same microtubule structures
here are found inside neurons. Here’s a synapse, two synapses, and in the dendrite
and there are also axons, where we find these microtubules.
Microtubules have been around a long time. And they led to the Penrose
Hameroff Orch-OR Theory of Quantum Computation in Brain Neuron
Microtubules, where inside a neuron we have microtubules and each of their
sub-units acts as a quantum bit, or qubit, giving rise to global quantum coherence.
I will talk about that later. I just want to briefly give you a glimpse of that.
Let’s go back more or less to the beginning of the study of consciousness. The
Greeks, Plotinus, I used to think Plato said this but somebody corrected me,
observed that reality, his version of reality, is merely a representation in his
brain. Light bounces off the tree, goes to his eyes, and he has a representation
of the tree in his head. And you can see even with the Greeks the tradition of
using the word «bing» to denote phenomenal conscious experience began. That’s
a joke, but you’ll see in the course of this lecture I’ll use bing to indicate the hard
problem of phenomenal experience.
Now, the representation of reality in our head may poorly represent actual
reality. We don’t really know. And this is exemplified by Plato’s cave allegory,
where these guys could only see two dimensions and for them, that was reality.
Two dimensions was all there was, and that was perfectly fine. And so he’s getting
bing out of a two-dimensional shadow world, suggesting that there may be a
deeper reality for us that we’re not normally seeing.
Descartes picked up on this idea that reality is a construction in the head and
observed that for all we know, we could be a mere brain in a vat fed information
by an evil genius. So here’s a brain in a vat who’s being fed information and he
or she thinks I’m walking outside in the sun, when he’s actually in a vat. And
this has been the script for many science fiction movies. And this led Descartes
to say that we’re only certain that we’re conscious. I think, therefore I am.
For Descartes the observer was an immaterial soul hovering above his head,
through the pineal gland gained entrance, and it’s the soul that had the conscious
observation. The bing experience, according to Descartes. Of course this is
Cartesian dualism, where mind and matter are separated irreconcilably as if
separated by a brick wall. Now, Greeks including Aristotle suggested that the
brain, actually Aristotle said the heart, but we’ll cut him some slack and give
him credit for saying the brain, projects mental qualities out onto the world. So
the bing is projected out onto the world and this is a form of idealism where
mind generates matter.
Another view in Eastern philosophy is that consciousness pervades a deeper
level of reality. Bing is pretty much everywhere, and when you meditate you get
in touch with it. And this is a form of pan-psychism where mind and matter are
more or less equivalent and/or can be considered a form of neutral monism. We
heard about monism yesterday. I don’t know if anybody mentioned neutral
monism, which was started by Spinoza; also William James and Bertrand Russell,
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

643

where there’s some underlying deeper reality which gives rise to matter and
mind. And so this is neutral monism. We’ll come back to this point, because this
works very well with the quantum paradigm.
And finally, the most popular view, materialism or reductionism where matter
generates mind: brain equals mind equals computer. This would be the most
popular view amongst scientists, certainly, and is pretty much the basis for
modern science’s understanding of brain function. It doesn’t quite explain
consciousness, however. But let’s look at this, because I think we can learn a lot
from what’s perceived. Modern science sees the brain as a computer in which
nerve cells over here and synapses, we can’t really see in the connections between
the nerve cells, act like nodes and switches in a computer matrix over here;
essentially the same thing.
Descartes came up with a scheme for organising consciousness based on a
theatre analogy. And he said that the contents of consciousness are like a play
on a stage, with actors, props, script, and so forth going into determine what’s
on the stage, which is then viewed by the audience, the observer sitting out in
the theatre. Now, of course Descartes didn’t have to worry about the audience
too much because he had the soul hovering above his head, but the rest of us
worry about who the audience is and who the observer is.
But this architecture was very useful. It was picked up by Simon and Newell,
who developed computer architectures based very much on Descartes’ theatre
metaphor, which was called the global workspace or the CPU where various
forms of inputs went into this, and then an output to a monitor which somebody
could watch. But it’s very similar to the Descartes’ theatre.
And finally in the 1980s, a number of neuroscientists including Bernie Baars,
Gerald Edelman, Giulio Tononi, Sean Joe Dehain, Kirk and Kolk and others,
cast thalamocortical oscillations as the version of Cartesian theatre or the global
workspace, where sensory inputs and various other inputs went into the
thalamocortical system which arose to cortex and then feed back to thalamus.
And this reverberation was thought to be the site of consciousness, bing, and
that’s pretty much the modern view among neuroscientists; Global Workspace
Theory, thalamocortical oscillations.
However, this is based strictly on sensory stimuli and arousal, bottom-up and
top-down. What about mental states without sensory inputs and arousal? Task
for example, task-free stimulus independent thought, internally generated states,
mind wandering, episodic memory, meditation, daydreaming, these don’t require
sensory input. And it turns out that we spend about half our time in these mind
wandering or similar modes. Marcus Raichle described this as default mode
networks, so the brain’s dark energy in this paper, and there’s been a lot of work
since showing these particular brain areas that are active when we’re not in our
sensory processing mode; when we’re mind wandering or daydreaming.
The default mode networks mediate episodic memory, if you just remember
something, introspection, self-referential thought, daydreaming and so forth.
Thinking about consciousness, meditation, maybe the Jamesian fringe, that’s
outside of consciousness, a Freudian id; maybe also context and filling in for

644

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

sensory processing. So these are different from what we do just processing
information from the outside world, and Raichle showed that there are two types
of networks that are anti-correlated. So we’re either in our mode of processing
sensory information, or we’re in our daydreaming mode, and we toggle or flip
back and forth.
These blue spots are low activity in the default mode networks and down to
here, this person has gone into high activity in the default mode networks. So
between this and this, they’ve switched from, say, paying attention and processing
sensory information in the here and now, to daydreaming and mind wandering,
and this happens on an average of every 10 seconds. Very roughly. So aside from
conscious versus non-conscious distinction, we know that the brain operates in
these two distinct modes. Attention-based sensory processing, task performance,
thalamocortical…
Let’s say you’re driving your car in heavy traffic. You’re paying attention. So
that’s… that would be this. And then you’re on a smooth road and nothing’s
happening, and you’re daydreaming about something else, you go into this other
mode of mind wandering, episodic memory, internally generated states, and the
activity has shifted. The conscious activity, whatever it is, has shifted to the
default mode networks, different regions of the brain. And these flip back and
forth between the two on the order of very roughly every 10 seconds. These are
the anti-correlated networks.
That doesn’t really tell us about consciousness because the default mode
networks can either be conscious or non-conscious, and the sensory processing
can be either conscious or non-conscious. What it does tell us is that consciousness
may involve a self-organising neuronal processing in the brain moving back and
forth between these two networks. So one moment it’s in the sensory processing
mode, and the next moment it’s wandered off into the daydreaming mode.
So how do we picture this? We know that the brain has various types of
functions, sensory perception, behaviour, learning, memory, sleep, and so forth.
You can read them, and all of these may be at one point non-conscious or at other
times conscious. When they’re non-conscious, they’re known as the easy problems
of Dave Chalmers; or the zombie modes; or the autopilot, as if we’re on autopilot.
So you know what an autopilot is. The pilot can press a button and go wander off,
flirt with a stewardess, or have a meal, or take a nap, go to the bathroom, and
everything’s fine. The plane’s flying on autopilot until there’s some turbulence,
and then he comes back and takes over. We’ll come back to the autopilot.
Now, these same functions can also be processed consciously. Sensory
perception, controlled behaviour, can also be conscious. So the bing can occur
in different parts of the brain at different times. And usually not all of these
things are going on at the same time, but we can have these different modes
shifting back and forth from moment to moment as consciousness moves and
redistributes through the brain. So this is I think an important point that
consciousness actually moves around the brain, and wherever it is, that’s what
is brought into consciousness. And it moves around the brain in a zone of gamma
synchrony EEG.

Now, gamma synchrony EEG is the best correlate of consciousness. We get
beautiful pictures out of FMRI, and they show us the anatomy beautifully, but
they don’t have any temporal resolution, and they don’t really help us in terms
of what consciousness is, it just tells us where. So as you know, EEG recorded
from the scalp or brain surface gives a bunch of squiggly lines, which if you do
a Fourier transform, you break into frequency modes, and gamma 30 to 90 hertz,
used to be called coherent 40 hertz, but it can be 30 to 90, correlates best with
consciousness. Particularly when it’s from one part of the brain to the other,
that’s the best marker of consciousness; so coherence in the gamma synchrony.
Gamma synchrony also can correlate with elevated states of consciousness.
In this famous study by Lutz et al in PNAS, they study Tibetan monks who had
been chosen by the Dalai Lama for being the best meditators. They had the
highest gamma synchrony ever recorded. Instead of 40 where you and I probably
are, they were 80 to 100, even at rest before they started meditating. And then
when they meditated they went even higher in terms of frequency, amplitude,
and coherence. The controls were college kids they taught to meditate for a
couple days. They had gamma and they had bing, but not nearly to the degree
as the monks. So it’s a marker of also level of consciousness.
It also tells us that consciousness is momentary, for example, at 40 cycles per
second or 40 moments per second. And a sequence of moments causes each
other, each one lasts only a short period of time, and advanced meditators are
able to detect the transition from moment to moment. And one described them
as 1/64th of a snap of a finger. So whatever time that is, I’m not sure, that’s how
long a moment of consciousness lasts.
Other Buddhists actually quantified the number in a way, I don’t know how
they did it. But, for example, they counted six and a half million conscious
moments in 24 hours, which is actually one 13.3 milliseconds, or 75 hertz, and
Chinese Buddhists as 50 per second. And both of these are in the range for
gamma synchrony. So it’s pretty convincing that Buddhist texts from thousands
of years ago and modern electrophysiology both give this idea that we have
conscious moments roughly 30 to 90 per second. James also described
consciousness as specious moments in a stream, and Alfred North Whitehead
had occasions of experience. So Whitehead also had discreet conscious moments.
How do we get conscious moments and experience out of neural function?
Here’s a brain cell, the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron, which tells us how membrane
depolarisation occurs due to ion channels opening and closing. The dendrites
integrate information, have greater potentials. There’s a trigger, all or none, and
then a spike travels to the next set of neurons.
Here is a network of toy neurons where we have inputs going over here, each
one of these guys use either white or black depending on whether it’s active or
not. And one is active and zero is not, so we’ve inputs coming over here. We have
rules by the synaptic plasticity. This is typical neural net stuff, and I’m just using
it to illustrate a point. And we have outputs here, here, and here. If we let it run
and change the inputs, we just get different outputs. And do some fairly efficient
computing on the neural… neuron to neuron basis. I think Giorgio talked about
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

646

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

this yesterday. And this is pretty much the standard paradigm in neural science
in terms of how the brain and neurons compute.
But where is consciousness? Where is the bing, and specifically where is the
synchrony? Because in this type of network, there’s no synchrony. Synchrony is
something else. Presumably that explains non-conscious processing, so we can
explain the computerised non-conscious activities of the autopilot by that type
of network. But where’s the conscious pilot? Maybe somebody like John Travolta
shows up. Maybe he’s not the best paradigm of being conscious, but the point is
that consciousness can move around the plane and resume control of the cockpit.
How do we find something that moves around the brain and can correlate with
consciousness? Well, here’s another toy neuron. Here’s the three dendrites in a
cell body. Here’s the axon. And these three guys, these three dendrites, receive
information… integrate information and trigger a firing here, and here’s the
chemical synapse that we’ve all come to appreciate over the years. But there’s
another type of connection in the brain called a gap junction, electrical synapses,
and this type of connection synchronises this membrane and this membrane. So
this causes synchrony including gamma synchrony. So these types of connections,
cortical interneurons, glia, and other neurons, connected by gap junctions, are
active synchronously in the gamma range and correlate with consciousness.
If we have neurons connected dendrite to dendrite by gap junctions, as we
see here, as opposed to axon to dendrite as other types of networks… these
sideways connections, anywhere they’re synchronised, like the dancers holding
hands with kicking up their legs, the Rockettes. Anywhere you look in this system,
you’re going to see synchrony and coherence. And so this accounts for gamma
synchrony throughout wide regions of the brain, if not the entire brain. So here’s
a type of gamma gap junction suggesting some kind of quantum tunnelling
between the two.
So we go back to our network and now we put in gap junctions, here, and
allow them to open. And what happens is, as they grow larger, they reach a
threshold, and we start to get synchrony, which correlates with consciousness.
And we know that gamma synchrony correlates with consciousness, so we have
bing in a zone of gamma synchrony moving around the brain. And I think this
is how consciousness moves as a causal agent, as a mobile agent, moving around
the brain and wherever it goes, that’s where consciousness is. And I published
this in a paper called the Conscious Pilot, the conscious pilot being the zone of
synchrony moving around the brain, dendritic synchrony moves through the
brain to mediate consciousness, earlier this year.
Two examples of this are that gap junction-mediated gamma synchrony in
the olfactory bulb mediates conscious smell. This is the only sensory modality
that doesn’t require the thalamus. Signals from the odorants come through the
nose directly into the brain into the olfactory bulb and there gap junction mediated
gamma synchrony occurs, which correlates with conscious smell. And there are
the references for that.
One other example is that conscious feelings of pleasure and reward correlate
with gap junction-mediated gamma synchrony in dopaminergic nucleus
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

647

accumbens and other areas, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, ventral
tegmentum. And gamma synchrony mediated by gap junctions in these areas
correlate with pleasure. Now, we know that dopamine is involved and that this
may be the final common pathway for all forms of pleasure and reward, but the
gap junction-mediated gamma synchrony is right in there also. It can occur
regardless of what the neurotransmitter is.
I would say consciousness moves around the brain in the zone of gamma
synchrony, why is it conscious? Is it complexity? So many neurons, so much
computation? Not necessarily. For example, consider a single cell paramecium
which can learn, avoid predators, find food, find mates, have sex. It has no
synapses. It is only one cell. Here’s a paramecium that bumps into something
and backs up, it goes another way. If you suck it into a capillary tube, it escapes
faster and faster each time. It can avoid predators. And it can find a mate, and
here’s actually two paramecium having sex. And they actually fuse and become
one for about a minute, and then swim off and go their separate ways.
We don’t know that this is conscious, obviously, but it could be. And what
better way to promote evolution than to have sex, feel good and cause organisms
to want to do it? So the point is that this creature does this without any synapses.
I don’t think it is right to say that consciousness and cognition emerge from
complex interaction among neurons when we have single cells like a paramecium
that can do complex things. Not necessarily conscious, but certainly cognitive.
And I always ask my AI friends to simulate a paramecium before they worry
about a brain. So far nobody’s been able to do it.
This suggests that cognition, if not consciousness, can occur at multiple scales
and I just want to mention something, we’ll come back to this later. Scale-free
dynamics, otherwise known as fractal, as something like a hologram, where
there’s self-similarity across various scales, and frequency size, and energy. And
this is found widely in nature and in many systems in the brain in EEG activity,
in saccade movements in the eye and in other functions. So there may be this
hierarchical scaling going on and I’ll come back to that in a little bit.
To give you an example how that would work each… if you imagine these
are neurons, each one of them is connected in a small world local network but
also larger world, large scale networks. So neurons can participate in different
scale networks, and then we go inside neurons and it gets even more interesting.
So this is just the scale free idea that found in inner spikernels, EEG saccades,
eye movement, and neuronal structure nested networks. We have networks inside
networks, with time scales from tens of seconds as in the switching between the
default modes and the sensory modes, down to EEG and tens of seconds to 1,000
hertz. Consciousness and memory have long been considered holographic by
Pribram, Lashley and others.
Let us look inside the neuron to the microtubules and see if the scale of
reactivity can extend down there. This is the structure of a microtubule and
some of you may know that I got obsessed with microtubules when I was in
medical school 38 years ago. And I got the idea that they were organising things
and might be acting like computers. And if you look at their structure, they’re
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

648

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

made of these peanut-shaped tubulin proteins which can switch between states.
This is also a quantum state and this could process information.
I spent a number of years working on models of information processing and
microtubules including one very good paper with Steen Rasmussen, who was
here yesterday, showing that they could function as cellular automata or
molecular automata and process information based on dipole-dipole couplings.
This is the game of life, which is a form of molecular… cellular automata and
this is kind of a similar one in microtubules except based on the structure and
the dipole coupling strings among the neighbouring tubulins.
We showed information processing like this, which meant that each neuron
having something like 108 of these sub-units switching at 107 could have 1015
operations per second per neuron, whereas most people in AI were talking about
that same number for the entire brain. So we weren’t very popular among AI
people arguing for pushing the goal-post for brain equivalents way, way
downstream. So it does increase the brain, the information capacity per neuron
and per brain, although it doesn’t necessarily solve the problem of consciousness.
Microtubules are also involved in Alzheimer’s disease, which as you know
takes away memory and cognition and eventually consciousness. And basically
it’s because the microtubules more or less disintegrate because of these Tau
proteins which are attached to them, which get hyper-phosphorylated. And when
the microtubules fall apart, you lose memory, you lose cognition, and eventually
consciousness. Now, one interesting point is what Tau does. Tau is hyperphosphorylated and causes the microtubules to fall apart, but under normal
circumstances what does it do?
It turns out that Tau acts as a traffic signal for motor proteins transporting
synaptic materials. So here’s a neuron here, here’s a cell body, this is the axon.
Here’s a dendrite and we’ve zoomed in one little piece of the dendrite, and see
a microtubule inside of it, and so kinesin is moving material this way to a synapse
and it has to branch. And so the question is: how does the kinesin know where
to drop off its cargo? It’s kind of like FedEx or some postal service, it needs to
have an address, it needs to drop things off at a particular synapse, and it turns
out that Tau tells the kinesin when to get off and where to drop its material in
a particular synapse. And so then the question is, how does the Tau know where
to bind on the microtubule? There would have to be some kind of information
embedded in the microtubule for the tile to know where to bind.
I will say one more thing about memory. The basic idea in memory is synaptic
plasticity. If synapses become more sensitive, that enhances activity and that’s
learning. In long-term potentiation, which is a model for memory, part of it is
calcium comes in and activates the enzyme called CAMK2, which is a snowflakeshaped enzyme which then gets stuck on microtubules and are transported
somewhere; and phosphorylates something within the neuron, which records
long-term memory. The question is what is phosphorylated to recall to record
long-term memory?
We looked into this about a year ago. This work was done by Travis Craddock
and Jack Tuszynski in Canada collaborating with me. When the CAMK2 is
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

649

phosphorylated and activated by calcium, it transforms. Like in the movie
Transformers, where it changes shape, and extends six arm and six legs. I think
they’re both legs. Legs going up and legs going down, to form this nano-robot
or nano-poodle some people call it, funny looking thing, which is able to
phosphorylate and record memory inside the cell.
There’s six of these kinases coming down and each one can phosphorylate
or not, and therefore conveys a bit of information. And so you have six bits, or
a byte of information for each set of six kinase domains, and this shows where
the phosphorylation sites are, and somehow these sites phosphorylate a substrate
and memory is encoded or stored. Well, we thought, well, maybe they’re binding
to microtubules, so we did a comparison based on size and geometry. And here
is a microtubule at 20 nanometers, and here’s tubulin on the sub-unit of five
nanometers, with the phosphorylation sites. And then we asked, well, how does
the CAMK2 line up with the size and geometry of the microtubule? And the
answer is perfectly.
So here’s a microtubule A lattice, it’s a piece of a microtubule here and here.
This is the B lattice. And this is the CAMK2 with the top cut off. And overlying
here you see that it matches up perfectly for both the A lattice and the B lattice.
Therefore these CAMK2 kinases can phosphorylate microtubules and this is
what it would look like for a CAMK2 occupying six sites on a microtubule. And
here we show the nitty gritty details of the phosphorylation mechanism at the
level of the amino acids.
Finally the encoding capabilities from one little patch of a microtubule, from
one CAMK2, depending whether it’s binary, trinary, and a couple other
assumptions, this gives you 64, 26 possible bits per byte. This is 500 and this is
5,000. So the amount of information capacity able to be phosphorylated onto
microtubules is enormous. We published this in the Journal of Integrative
Neuroscience not too long ago.
Here we have microtubules inside a neuron, and this is an electron micrograph,
some of these have been. The tops have been ripped off. But you can sort of see
the tubulins there. They’re interconnected by microtubular associated proteins,
so you have a network of these microtubules inside neurons. So it’s sort of a
fractal scale-free dynamic going down inside. So let’s go back to the basic idea
of the microtubule as computer, with the tubulins switching states and possibly
being in superposition of both states. So the control of the state is proposed to
be by what are called hydrophobic pockets, regions of the protein which have
non-polar amino acids that… which is where anaesthetics bind. Anaesthetics
bind on these little pockets and prevent the protein from doing its dynamics,
and ultimately block consciousness. And we’ll come back to that.
These hydrophobic pockets are formed by folding by these non-polar amino
acids conglomerating with each other in the interior and forming a secluded
environment. And when Steen was talking yesterday, I was trying to make the
point that what he’s talking about in terms of the olive oil is actually a very small
part of the phase diagram of a body. If you took any of us and grind us up in a
whirring blender and then looked at solubility zones and what in our bodies

would act as a solvent for different solutes, you could see all the different solvents
here. These two areas, the aliphatic and the aromatics, are where anaesthetics
bind; and also are non-polar and therefore optimal locations for quantum
processes.
They bind by the van der Waals force, the van der Waals-London force between
neutral, non-polar atoms or molecules. This happens to be neon, but it could be
the non-polar amino acids. So you start with eight of these electrons that are
balanced and then the electrons in one repel the electrons in the other, they form
little bar magnets or dipoles, which then attract each other. And this is the van
der Waals-London force. And a lot of the other… and it also shows how…
membranes can form and even… and proteins can form. And anaesthetics bind
by these same van der Waals-London forces between non-polar, polar, but
polarisable electron clouds.
Here’s the basic idea that the electron clouds are flipping back and forth,
controlling the protein, and controlling the switching. Now, it’s actually, as you
might imagine, much more complicated. This is more work from Travis Craddock
showing the location of the aromatic rings, just of tyrosine in the purple, and
the indole or tryptophan in the blue, and there’s actually pathways going through
that can conduct quantum information, but I’ll come back to that later. So it is
a bit more complicated than having just one or two aromatic rings. So the idea
for anaesthesia… well, the idea is that the electrons flip back and forth, control
the state of the protein. And anaesthetics get in there and block that activity,
and therefore block the activity of the proteins.
These structures, the opposite of the anaesthetic effect are drugs and molecules
which get into those hydrophobic pockets of receptors, and enhance the electron
resonance energy, and are hallucinogenic or psychoactive. And this includes
serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter, dopamine, and chocolate, which is
psychoactive as well as far more psychoactive compounds like LSD and DMT,
which is characterised by Rick Strassman as the spirit molecule, because it
induces what he interpreted as religious experience, I guess. But the point is
that these work by the same sort of van der Waals-London forces by promoting
the activity rather than impairing the activity.
It also gets us to the quantum level because the London forces are actually
quantum processes. And so we’ve gone from the scale of the whole brain down
to the level of quantum and we still haven’t found consciousness, so let’s keep
going and see if we can come up with something. We have to deal with quantum
mechanics now. Nobody really understands quantum mechanics. As Richard
Feynman famously said, anyone who claims to understand quantum physics is
either lying or crazy. But let’s just see what we can say about it.
The world appears divided into two realms, described by two different sets of
physical laws. Quantum is immaterial, it can be below the level of matter; coexisting possibilities, non-local, unified, connected, may have some ultimate truth,
deeper levels of reality, spirit-like. Classical, which is our Newtonian world that
we’re familiar with, is material, Newtonian, definite, macroscopic, local, predictable,
disconnected, maybe postmodern you might say; boring in some sense.

Four features of the quantum world. Quantum particles can exist in multiple
possible states or locations simultaneously. This pointer could be here and here
at the same time. Quantum particles which become separated remain connected
over distance and time, this is quantum entanglement. So if I had two of these
and separated them, and sent one over there and one over there, and measured
one over there, if you went over there it would instantaneously react. Einstein
didn’t like this and predicted it would fail, but it didn’t. It worked out. I’ll come
back to that.
Multiple particles can condense into one unified entity, quantum coherence,
and uncertainty. So just to give some illustrations, for superposition, behaving
like waves or multiple locations, here’s an electron not over time but at one
moment of time where it’s in concentric rings inside this quantum well. That is
one electron occupying these different rings. And here’s an electron with a spinup and a spin-down, which can be in both spin-up and spin-down at the same
time. Quantum superposition.
Now, the superpositions also lead to entanglement and this is what Einstein
didn’t like. Here’s two complementary, let us say electron spins. Spin both up
and down, both up and down but they’re complementary. You split them up,
you send one to, say, Barcelona and you send one to Valencia, and you make a
measurement in Barcelona. Instantaneously the one in Valencia has the opposite
or complementary state. If this is down, this is then up. If this is up, this is then
down, instantaneously many, many miles or kilometres apart.
Einstein predicted this wouldn’t work, and so he published the EPR paradox
in 35 with Podolsky and Rosen, describing an experiment. In 1985 this experiment
was done by Alain Aspect, and it was shown to actually work. And since then, it
has been done thousands and thousands of times. Zeilinger has done it between
mountain peaks in the Canary Islands, fibre optics under the Danube, off of
satellites, and so forth, and it works every time, it seems.
How does that happen? And the only explanation is that when you make a
measurement here, the quantum information goes backward in time to where
they were together, and then out this limb to carry this correlation. And backwards
in time is allowed in quantum physics. And it has been done between satellites
or as Zeilinger has done it, so distance doesn’t seem to matter. Non-local action
at a distance, what Einstein called spooky action at a distance.
The third aspect of the quantum world is that objects can condense into
unitary objects, quantum coherence of Bose-Einstein condensation, governed
by one wave function. If one component is perturbed, everybody feels it. So in
this ring here, all these molecules or whatever they are, are perfectly in lockstep.
They are acting like one entity, whereas the guys outside of it are random and
chaotic. So this is like a laser, a Bose-Einstein condensate, where all of the
components act the same, precisely the same. And this unity has been thought
to mediate the unity of consciousness. Of course, there’s only one of us inside
our brain.
These quantum effects are using quantum information technology, quantum
computers where information is represented not only as bits of one or zero, but
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

652

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

also quantum bits of one and zero, superposition one and zero. The cubits
communicate and collapse to an answer. Quantum cryptography, where the
quantum states are transmitted by non-local entanglement. This is now used
commercially. And quantum teleportation, where you communicate a state of
a particle by non-local entanglement, destroying the original, and transporting
it somewhere else.
I think most of us have probably watched Star Trek and saw beam me up,
Scotty, which was presumably a form of teleportation. Nobody’s done it for a
whole person, and probably never will, but they have done it for small quantum
particles and quantum objects. It does happen, although it may be limited.
But why don’t we see quantum superpositions in our world? We only see one
of these. We don’t see things in multiple places in the same time. This question has
been around since the turn of the last century, and your answer depends on your
interpretation of quantum mechanics. It’s almost different religions, actually. Now,
one is that conscious observation collapses the wave function. This came from
Niels Bohr and Eugene Wigner, who noticed that if a machine observes a quantum
superposition, the results in the machine seemed to stay in both possibilities until
a human actually looked at the results. They said that consciousness collapses the
wave function; conscious observation.
Schrodinger didn’t like that, he thought it was kind of silly. And so he came
up with another thought experiment called Schrodinger’s cat, where a quantum
particle out here, outside this closed box, for example, a photon going through
a half-silvered mirror, 50% probability. Since it is a quantum property, quantum
particle, it both goes through and doesn’t go through. It enters the box and doesn’t
enter the box. It releases the poison and doesn’t release the poison. It kills the
cat and doesn’t kill the cat. Schrodinger said, if this interpretation is correct,
until someone opens the box and looks, the cat is both dead and alive.
It was obviously bizarre but it was a pragmatic solution for Bohr, who wanted
to do experiments. But it put consciousness outside of science. Consciousness
became something weird, outside of science, you just bring it in when you need
to collapse the wave function. We don’t really know what it is. The other problem
is that nobody’s determined how big a quantum system can be, whether
something as large as a cat can actually be in two states at the same time.
Another view of what happens to superpositions is the multiple worlds or
parallel universe idea, where every time there’s a superposition, there’s a separation
in reality, underlying fabric of the universe separates and branches off and forms
a whole new universe. Here we see multiple overlapping universes, and this is
actually a very popular idea, because it works out mathematically and is unmessy
except for the infinite number of universes. There’s also decoherence, which is
what happens when the environment interacts, but we’re talking about things that
are isolated from decoherence.
And finally Roger Penrose came up with an idea that brought consciousness
back into science. He said that a superposition will continue until it reaches an
objective threshold for quantum state collapse, a reduction called objective
reduction. And he defined the threshold as e = h/T, where e is the amount of
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

653

superposition, so a larger superposition would have a greater e, and T is inversely
related. So a large e will have a short T, and vice-versa.
For example, an electron, something very small in superposition isolated
from decoherence, would eventually reach T after 10 million years. A long time.
Something very large, like nanograms of tubulin in our brain, reaches threshold
in 40 times a second, 25 milliseconds. So a large system such as the brain has
evolved can have this happen fairly frequently. Roger proposed in his 1989 book,
The Emperor’s New Mind, that this was the origin of consciousness for reasons
that get into Gödel’s Theorem and many other things. And it is a relatively rare
occurrence on the edge between the quantum and classical worlds, and is
equivalent to consciousness.
He’s saying that the superpositions are happening in the brain and the selfcollapse is happening in the brain, so unlike the Copenhagen interpretation
where consciousness is outside and collapses the wave function, the superposition,
the dead cat and the live cat, are inside the head or inside the brain. We have a
superposition of both or multiple possibilities, which go along and reach threshold
and self-collapse, and we have a moment of consciousness. And that happens
over and over and over and over again. That’s the basic idea.
He was saying, it bears repeating, that consciousness is an actual physical
process, a sequence of quantum state reductions connected by e = h/T to an
objective threshold to give rise to bing. In other words, consciousness is built
into the universe, it is because that is what causes the collapse. Well, actually, I
should explain that. Why does that cause collapse? Penrose took the problems
of superposition seriously. Rather than trying to find a pragmatic solution, he
asked the question, what does it mean for something to be in two states at the
same time, or two places at the same time? Well, he went back to Einstein, who
showed that the universe has an underlying structure which curves. Einstein
talked about this for big objects like the sun, so the light would curve around
the sun and you could see it. Arthur Eddington did that experiment proving that
spacetime curved.
But Penrose said it also holds for small objects, small curvatures. For example,
a tubulin protein in two different states is a curvature. So here we’ve taken
spacetime into just two dimensions. We’ve got three dimensions on one axis;
three dimensions of space, one axis of time. The tubulin, or anything in one
particular conformation is curvature into the screen, and tubulin in another
conformation is out towards us, and flipping back and forth is actually flipping
between two curvatures in space-time geometry.
Now, if you have superposition, you have both of these, and you have a
curvature towards us and away from us. You have basically a bubble or separation
in underlying spacetime geometry. And this is what the multiple worlds theory
says, too, that a superposition separates reality and branches off to form a whole
new universe. But Penrose said, no, these separations are unstable, and after a
certain time, T, they will collapse to one or the other, at this given time, T. And
when that happens, that’s consciousness. So it’s like the multiple worlds except
there’s a threshold built in, because the separations are unstable. So when this
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

654

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

happens, when T is reached, bing happens at this self-collapse, and either this
one or this one is chosen.
Now, the other thing he put in, which is pretty significant, is that the choices
of this one or this one are not random as they are with decoherence or measurement,
but are influenced by information embedded in the universe; what he called platonic
values. Here is quantum superpositions preceding and then a threshold is reached
here, and the cycle begins again, in a piece of microtubule. And in our model the
quantum states spread between neurons through gap junctions by tunnelling and
therefore can go throughout the entire brain.
That is a summary of the model, the quantum computation and brain
microtubules, which gives among other things the possibility for real time
causality and free will. We were talking yesterday about the fact that activity
that seems to correlate with consciousness happens after we’ve responded, so
that people, most neuroscientists and philosophers say that we act unconsciously,
on autopilot, and have a consciousness that’s epiphenomenal and illusory after
the fact. But with quantum you get the backward time effects, and I’ll talk a little
bit more about that in a second. It gives you the possibility for real time causal
efficacy and free will. It also makes a connection to quantum space-time geometry.
Now, by the way, this is a picture from 1994, there’s Roger, there’s Dave
Chalmers, there is me about to fall into the Grand Canyon there. We went there
after the first Tucson conference, and this is where we started seriously developing
our model. So the basic idea is we have a protein qubit which correlates with
the spacetime qubit so a quantum computation happening in the microtubule
in the brain is actually happening at the level of spacetime geometry in the brain,
because spacetime is everywhere. You can’t get away from it.
One conscious moment would look something like this. The quantum
computing is in here, reaches threshold, there is an objective reduction and a
moment of consciousness here at 25 milliseconds. It needn’t be exactly that.
Here it’d be normal experience, a series of these conscious moments at 40 hertz.
If you add anaesthesia, they stop. If you’re excited, they happen more frequently.
Let’s say you go from 40 to 60 to 80 hertz, maybe like the monks. If you’re in an
altered state, it goes even higher and faster, and your perception of the outside
world would slow down. And you don’t go to baseline, so you merge quantum
information, dreamlike information, with consciousness in altered states. And
dreaming would be something like that.
Here is the 25 milliseconds; bing, bing, bing, every 25 milliseconds. And notice
that quantum information is sent backwards in time, so this can get us out of
the problem of consciousness being epiphenomenal because of the backward
time effects. Now, critics jump up. We have been criticised severely ever since
even before we published our first paper, by critics who say all kinds of things.
Including, well, everybody knows the brain is too warm, wet, and noisy for
quantum effects because if you build a quantum computer in the laboratory,
you have to do it at absolute zero to avoid decoherence.
We said, well, biology is pretty smart. Billions of years of evolution figured
it out. They kept on criticising us, which was fine. But then the data started to
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

655

come in, and show that actually warm temperature is not a problem for quantum
coherence or quantum properties. For example, this paper in 2003 studied
quantum spin transfer between quantum dots. So the green and the red are the
quantum dots, and they’re connected by benzene rings. The exact same structure
that’s found inside proteins, that is found in the hydrophobic pockets that are
mediating the switching in tubulin. And if you measure the quantum spin transfer
from dot to dot through the benzene, you get quantum interference. You get
quantum superposition and quantum effects. And if you do that as a function
of temperature through the benzene ring, you go from absolute zero. At about
70 kelvin there is a big jump and it persists out to brain temperature. So this
quantum process is actually driven, and enhanced, and requires heat.
In 2007, papers started coming out about quantum coherence and warm
temperatures in photosynthesis. And it turns out that plants utilise photosynthesis,
they collect sunlight and transfer the energy to another part of the cell, by electron
quantum coherence. With the electrons occupying all possible routes at the same
time, so quantum coherence superposition in photosynthesis, providing all the
food we eat or animals eat, which we then eat. This is really the key to life right
here. Here’s an article, Nature’s hot green quantum computers revealed.
And the other thing that’s even more exciting for me, anyway, is the work of
Anirban Bandyopadhyay at the National Institute of Material Sciences in Tsukuba,
Japan. He hasn’t published this yet, but he’s talking about it at meetings. He’s
being very careful. And he’s already published in Nature, so he’s got a lot of
credibility. But basically Pokorny discovered megahertz coherence in microtubules,
and using megahertz coherence to excite the microtubules, Anirban found
quantum conductance in topological qubit at room temperature in microtubules.
That hasn’t been published yet, but when he does, it’ll be very good news for our
model.
Just to sum up where we are with the model, we’ve been criticised incessantly,
but we’re still out there. And actually things seem to be breaking in our direction
in terms of incoming data. But it’s still just a theory. I think it’s the most complete
theory, especially with the conscious pilot involved. Just a couple other things
about it, is that, let’s say you’re making a decision, how would that look in terms
of spacetime geometry?
You see a woman across the street, is it Amy, Betty, or Carol? Were you trying
to decide what they had for lunch, shrimp, sushi, or pasta? So this could be
algorithmic processing, but it could also be a superposition of all three possibilities.
And for some reason, some intuition, you’re not quite sure why, you decide that’s
Carol. Or, I think I just feel like having sushi. So this type of choice could be made
by objective reduction with influence by these platonic values, which I’ll come
back to.
Now, the hard problem Steen Rasmussen was talking about the hard problem,
of how you solve Chalmer’s hard problem of phenomenal experience, and what
we say is that the essence of experience is encoded in fundamental spacetime
geometry. The conventional view would be, she looks at the rose, and there’s a
pattern of activity in her brain, and that gives rise to bing. What would we say
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

656

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

is that happens, but also the essential feature of the rose is a pattern in spacetime
geometry. Much more than three qubit, but and when, by entanglement, that is
reproduced in the head, in her brain, so she has the exact same spacetime
geometry configuration and captures the central phenomenology of the rose by
having the same spacetime geometry. Essentially it’s like having the rose inside
her brain.
So again, why would that be conscious, though? And a number of people,
including Penrose, and Freeman Dyson said that mind and intelligence are woven
into the fabric of the universe suggesting that qualia, the essential features of
conscious experience, might be part of the universe. So what is the fabric of the
universe? Well, if we go down in scale, down every ten orders of magnitude,
orders and orders of magnitude starting at the level of atoms, so from our scale
down to atoms everything’s kind of smooth and featureless until we get to the
Planck scale, at 10–33 centimetres, where we have information, and coarseness,
and irregularity.
Another way to look at it is starting on the level of protein to atoms, everything’s
kind of smooth and featureless. When you get down to about 10–32, 10–33, we start
to see patterns and information irregularities. Now, what that looks like, actually,
nobody knows for sure, but it’s been approached a number of different mechanisms,
through string theory, and loop quantum gravity. And the best guesses are the fine
structure of the universe looks something like this. And they’re actually pretty
similar.
In both of them, you get down to volumes that have, on an average, once
Planck length on a side. They could have multiple edges and multiple lengths,
so the number of different voxels is vast, and so the way this is put together nonlocally and holographically gives rise to spacetime geometry. Now, Penrose,
Dyson, David Bohm, and we’re going to hear about him in a moment, precursors
of consciousness, life, and platonic values may be irreducibly embedded at this
level, like mass, spin or charge. This is consistent with Buddhism, Vedic teachings,
Shamyana teachings, the Akashic record in Hindu teachings. And again, Penrose
said that platonic values are embedded in the Planck scale geometry, and
influenced the choices, so that the choices can be influenced by platonic
information.
To illustrate that, here’s a robot windsurfer who’s sailing, let’s say to A, but
the platonic values and spacetime illustrated by the wind here is going to push
him or her to A or C every once in a while. You could think of this in the way of
divine guidance or the way of the Tao, if you just allow yourself to be mindful
and not act rashly or reflexively, you can be influenced by, you call it intuition,
call it insight, call it whatever you want. But it could be platonic information
embedded in the universe.
Now, is this really feasible? Information from the Planck scale? Actually, yes.
Recently it’s been shown that there may be information coming from the Planck
scale already. There’s a big gravity wave detector in Germany, British Germany
GEO600 experiment, looking for gravitational waves from super-dense
astronomical objects, which they haven’t found yet. But they have encountered
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

657

inexplicable noise which repeats at multiple spatial temporal scales, like the
scale-free dynamics, and this guy Craig Hogan actually predicted that this would
appear and then sure enough it did. And he says that the noise is coming from
Planck scale fluctuations, and they suggest the universe is a giant hologram. And
this information repeats in a self-similar way every three orders of magnitude
from the Planck scale on up to getting within near the biological levels, and near
to actually microtubule dynamics.
That is the model. I begin to wrap up here and put it in the context of
spirituality, just to look at the distinctions between the quantum world and the
classical world. The quantum world is multiple coexisting possibilities, the
classical world definite. The quantum world, deep interconnectedness, isolated,
disconnected, timeless, flow of time, access to universal mind in the dark, spiritual
question mark, material. I think this is… this best fits with neutral monism, and
I showed a picture of neutral monism earlier, where instead of some unspecified
deeper reality, we have Planck scale space-time geometry, which ultimately does
give rise to everything.
And depending on how the quantum collapse occurs, if it occurs by
decoherence or measurement, you get matter. If it occurs by Penrose’s objective
reduction or by Orch-OR you get matter and mind. So this is how consciousness
can arise in the context of neutral monism from one underlying entity, namely
quantum spacetime geometry. The other thing it suggests is that consciousness
is on the edge between the quantum and classical worlds, because you have the
quantum world which self-collapses and more or less creates the classical world,
so it’s a process on the edge. I use the yin yang to illustrate this. Consciousness
is literally on the edge between the quantum and classical worlds.
I want to talk a little bit about near-death and out-of-body experiences, because
I’m in clinical medicine, and we hear about this a lot. And there have been a
number of studies which show that when patients have cardiac arrests, 17% is
the number I keep hearing, report near-death and out-of-body experiences. And
actually people can have those spontaneously without near-death. And the
phenomenology is a white light in a tunnel, that’s very, very common. In some
cases actually, out-of-body experience, so like this picture, she’s waving goodbye
to her body. And if the patient is resuscitated or revived, they go back inside and
say, hey, I was floating around on the ceiling. And if they die, well, we don’t
know. But this has been reported so many times that it’s really difficult to ignore.
Last year there were two studies that addressed this problem. One was by
Lakhmir Chawla at George Washington University, who was studying terminally
ill patients who were on ventilators and support for their blood pressure, pressers.
So they were getting IVs to maintain their blood pressure and heart, and they
were on a ventilator machine to breathe for them. And for various reasons they
were hopeless and they and their family decided to terminate, to pull the plug
if you will.
And Chawla has a protocol for allowing patients to die with dignity, and he
used a brain monitor called a BIS or another called a SEDLine, that gives the EEG
information zero to 100. And we use this in anaesthesia all the time. And 80 to
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

658

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

100 is where awake people are, where hopefully most of us are now. 80 to 100.
Between 40 and 60 is where you want to your patients under anaesthesia. If they’re
between 40 and 60, the manufacturer will tell you that they won’t remember and
they’re not conscious. And down here they’re pretty close to brain dead.
In Chawla’s study, and also in another study by David Owyang on patients
who were allowed to die before giving up their organs, they put this brain monitor
on and this is typical of what they found. They are down around zero, and by
this time the heart has stopped. There’s no blood pressure. And the BIS number,
the brain monitor level has gone to zero, and then there’s this burst of activity,
which in this case lasts 20 minutes. Now, these lasted 90 seconds to 20 minutes.
This is the longest one. And notice they are up around 90. They’re up between
80 and 100, which is an indicator of being awake, of being conscious. And in
one study they looked at the raw data, and it showed gamma synchrony EEG,
suggesting that there was some kind of awareness.
Whether there was or not, we don’t know, because these patients died. That
was the point, their support was being withdrawn, but Chawla wrote about that,
that this could be the near-death phenomenology, the… maybe even out-of-body
experience. And who knows, maybe it’s a sign of the soul leaving the body, we
don’t really know. But it’s a mystery as to how the metabolically dead brain,
which is acidotic, hypoxic, ischemic, has this burst of activity which is coherent
and global. It can’t just be a spasmodic discharge as some people said because
the whole… it’s coherent over the entire brain, in this case lasted 20 minutes.
So we’re going to be hearing more about this, because a number of other people
are doing these types of studies on end-of-life brain activity. This is a quick video.
I’m not sure it’s going to work.
Basically that was a TV show called Miracle Detectives, which is going to be
on the Oprah Network, and they were investigating a reincarnation case, and
they asked me if or how it is possible that there could be life after death. Basically
what I said was, under normal circumstances, consciousness is occurring in
spacetime geometry in the brain, around the microtubules. When the blood stops
flowing and the coherence is lost, the quantum information isn’t destroyed, but
can leak out or dissipate to the universe at large, but remain entangled as a soul,
if you will, and persist indefinitely or go back in the body as a near death
experience or maybe even reincarnation.
That gives rise to what could be called a quantum soul plausibility argument,
where consciousness is seen as quantum entanglement and fundamental
spacetime geometry. And this paradigm gives the following, which I think relate
to spirituality: A connection among living beings and among living beings in the
universe by entanglement; near-death and out-of-body; the possibility of afterlife
and reincarnation; and the capability for wisdom and platonic ethical values in
the universe to influence our choices.
Coming back to the original question, the origin of consciousness, the three
possibilities, I would say I favour the last one, which actually kind of encompasses
all three. I think the precursor of consciousness has been in the universe all
along, but then at some point we animals developed the capacity for Orch-OR,
PENSAMIENTO, vol. 67 (2011), núm. 254

pp. 641-659

SESSION III: THE QUANTUM MIND: STUART HAMEROFF

659

or OR, to have conscious moments connecting to the fine structure of spacetime
geometry. Which means that consciousness is really a self-organising process
at the fundamental level of the universe.
He final point is a theory I just want to mention by Paola Zizzi, an Italian
astrophysicist, who was studying the big bang and the period of rapid
cosmological inflation. And during the big bang the universe expanded very
rapidly for a very brief period of time and then stopped expanding rapidly and
has been expanding slowly ever since. She used e = h/T, the equation for Penrose’s
objective reduction, using e as the mass of the universe, and as you might expect
at a very short T, something like 10–33 seconds, which is when inflation ended.
So she proposed that during the big bang, the universe had a cosmic conscious
moment, which was dubbed the big wow by somebody else. In other words, it
was an OR event that occurred at the origin of the universe.
I want to mention the conference we’re having in Stockholm in May. Roger
Penrose will be there and Deepak Chopra. We’re going to have sessions on brain
fields, consciousness in the universe, quantum biology, anaesthesia, end-of-life
brain activity, transcranial therapies, time, backward time effects, and many
others; and the varieties of religious experience, consciousness, reality in the
universe.
To close, let me just say that I would say the precursors or components of
consciousness, proto qualia or proto-conscious qualia, have been the universe all
along as irreducible components of Planck scale geometry, along with mass, spin,
or charge. They just came along with the territory. Quantum processes in biology
evolved to best access and select proto-conscious precursors, so we do it better
than lesser developed animals, I would say. And consciousness as a process rooted
in fundamental spacetime geometry, plausibly allows for non-local conscious
awareness, and spirituality and something like the quantum soul.
