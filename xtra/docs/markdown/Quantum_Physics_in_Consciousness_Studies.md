Introduction in quantum aspects of brain function
Since the development of QM and relativistic theories in the first part of the 20 th century,
attempts have been made to understand and describe the mind or mental states on the basis of
QM concepts (see Meijer, 2014, Meijer and Korf, 2013,). Quantum physics, currently seen as a
further refinement in the description of nature, does not only describe elementary
microphysics but applies to classical or macro-physical (Newtonian) phenomena as well.
Hence the human brain and its mental aspects are associated to classical brain physiology and
are also part of a quantum physical universe. Most neurobiologists considered QM mind
theories irrelevant to understand brain/mind processes (e.g. Edelman and Tononi, 2000;
Koch and Hepp, 2006).
However, there is no single theory on QM brain/mind theory. In fact a spectrum of more or
less independent models have been proposed, that all have their intrinsic potentials and
problems. The elements of quantum physics discussed here are summarized in Table 1 and 2;
details of the various QM theories have been described elsewhere (Meijer, 2012; Meijer and
Korf, 2013).
Some QM mind options assume some sort of space-time multidimensionality, i.e there are
more than the four conventional space-time dimensions. Other options assume that one or
more extra dimensions are associated with a mental attribute or that the individual mind is
(partly) an expression of a universal mind through holonomic communication with quantum
fields (Fig.1). The latter idea has led to holographic (holonomic) theories (Pribram 1986, 2011).
The human brain is then conceived as an interfacing organ that not only produces mind and
consciousness but also receives information. The brain or parts of the brain are conceived as an
interference hologram of incoming data and already existing data (a “personal universe”). If
properly exposed (“analyzed”), information about the outer world can be distilled.
In neurobiological terms, the existing data is equivalent to the subject’s memory, whereas the
“analyzer” is cerebral electrophysiology. Bohm hypothesized that additional dimensions are
necessary to describe QM interference processes, thereby circumventing probabilistic theories
and consciousness-induced collapse of the wave function. In this theory, the universe is a giant
superposition of waves, representing an unbroken wholeness, of which the human brain is a
part (Bohm, 1990). Accordingly, the individual mind or consciousness is an inherent property
of all matter (and energy), and as such being part, or rather an expression, of this universal
quantum field. The apparently diffuse time/space localization of mental functions argues in
favor of an underlying multidimensional space/time reality. Bohm and Hiley (1987) also
proposed a two-arrow (bidirectional) time dimension. In this concept the stochastic (or double
stochastic) character of quanta is explained by an underlying quantum field: the implicate order.
This concept implies entanglement (non-locality) as well.
2

Another hypothesis, having the potential to couple wave information to mental processes,
proposes that wave information is transmitted from and into the brain by wave resonance.
Through conscious observation they collapse locally to material entities (Stapp 2009; Pessa
and Vitiello, 2003; Schwartz et al., 2004). Stapp (2012) argued that this does not represent an
interference effect between superposed states (as assumed by Hameroff and Penrose, 1996), but
that through environmental de-coherence, super-positions become informative to the
brain/organism. A complementary implication of these theories is that mental processes are
not necessarily embedded in entropic physical time. In line with this QM idea is that memories
are not stored as a temporal sequence, but rather a-temporally.

Fig. 1: The hypothesis that the universe and our minds are integral parts of a universal
consciousness
Some QM mind theories suppose the possible involvement of specific molecules. A spectrum
of ions and molecules has been suggested to operate in a quantum manner (Tuszinsky and
Woolf 2010). For instance QM theories have been based on micro-tubular proteins (Penrose
1989; Hameroff 2007), proteins involved in synaptic transmission (Beck and Eccles 1992; Beck
2001), including Ca ion-channels (Stapp 2009) and channel proteins instrumental in the
initiation and propagation of action potentials (potassium-ion channels, Bernroider and Roy
2004. There is also the hypothesis that synaptic transmission represents a typical (quantum)
probability state that becomes critical for an all or none neuronal response (Beck and Eccles
1992; Beck 2001). Attributing non-linear and non-computable characteristics of consciousness,
3

Hameroff and Penrose, 2011, 2013, argue against mechanisms of all or none firing of axonal
potentials (Beck and Eccles, 2003). They rather prefer the model of Davia (2010), proposing
that consciousness is related to waves traveling in the brain as a uniting life principle on
multiple scales. According to some QM mind theories (Woolf and Hameroff, 2001), tunneling
was proposed to facilitate membrane/vesicle fusion in neural information processing at the
synapse.
Kauffman relates quantum processes in the biological matrix of the brain to the emergence of
mental processing (Kauffman 2010; Vattay et al. 2012). This theory, mainly based on
chromophores detecting photons, assumes that the coherence of some quantum configurations
adhered to proteins is stabilized or is maintained by re-coherence. This principle may have
guided evolutionary selection of proteins. Accordingly, mind and consciousness are both
quantum mechanical and an expression by the classical neural mechanisms. The underlying
coherent quantum states provide the potentiality for the collapse to the de-coherent material
state, resulting in classical events such as firing neurons, that are at least to some extent, acausal, i.e. beyond classical determinacy. The quantum system (of the brain) interacts with a
quantum environment, the phase information is lost and cannot be reassembled. By
entanglement, the quantum coherence in a small region, e.g. the cell or the brain, might have
spatial long-range effects (Vattay et al. 2012; Hagan et al. 2002). Kauffman accepts long-lived
coherence states in biological molecules at body temperature (now 750 femto-seconds in
chlorophyll at 77K) to be potentially enabling parallel problem solving as major challenges for
further investigations. The question is also which neurons or neuronal structures are in
particular associated to the coherence/de-coherence brain model of consciousness.
The question is often put as to why quantum theory should be involved in discussions of
consciousness at all, and also as to why it should be treated as something special. In thinking
about quantum theory, it is important not to be bullied into viewing it as something weird and
peripheral that can be ignored (Atmanspacher, 2011). Unfortunately, this allows the more
superficial thinkers to dismiss all theories of quantum consciousness. This sort of practice has
recently been criticized as ‘pseudoscepticism’, a parallel form to pseudoscience. Pseudoskepticism (see Wikipedia) similarly uses denunciation in the name of science or scientific
affiliation without citing any evidence or possible experimentation to establish this criticism,
(see Utts and Josephson, 1996). The features of quantum theory that make it special and also
possibly relevant to consciousness can be summarized as follows:
1.) Quantum theory describes the fundamental level of energy and matter. In contrast to
higher levels, the quantum level has aspects, such as mass, charge and spin that are given
properties of the universe, not capable of further reduction or explanation. In quantum
theories of consciousness, it is suggested that consciousness is such a fundamental property
existing at this level. Some theories are additionally linked to the structure of spacetime, which
4

is nowadays seen as being interconnected with the nature of the quanta( see Chalmers, 2000;
Nagel, 2012)
2.) The other fundamental aspect of the universe is spacetime, as described by the special and
general theories of relativity. Although both relativity and quantum theory have both been
tested to very high degrees of accuracy, they are nevertheless incompatible with one another.
The gravitational force is the main problems, since the smooth continuous curvature of space
that describes gravity in general relativity is incompatible with the discreteness of
particles/waves that is fundamental to quantum theory. String theory and loop quantum
gravity have attempted to bridge this gap, but neither are yet regarded as giving a complete
picture. (see Smolin, 2004; Penrose, 2004)
3.) In traditional versions of quantum theory, the wave form of the quanta is conceived as a
superposition of the many possible positions of a quantum particle. When the wave function
collapses the choice of a particular position for the particle is random. This choice of position is
an effect without a cause. The property of randomness is not in itself particularly useful in
theories of consciousness, but it does open a chink in the deterministic structure of the
universe, which is exploited in particular by the Penrose/Hameroff model, 2013, see also
Stapp, 2009, 2012)
4.) Non-locality is the remaining special feature of quantum theory. Classical physics
comprises only so-called billiard ball relationships, with bits of matter and energy bumping
into one another. These relationships are local, in that they involve immediate contact. Such
relationships are also normal in quantum physics. However, quantum physics also possesses
non-local relationships. This applies where two particles have been in some close relationship,
such as two electrons in the same orbital. In this case they can become correlated. For instance
the spin on two particles may always be opposite, if one spins up, the other spins down. This
is not a problem while the particles are in a wave form, as both will be in a superposition of up
and down. However, if the wave function of one particles collapses, that particle chooses one
or the other superposition. When that happens, the other particle will choose the opposite
position. In experiment, this is shown to happen when the two particles are out of range of a
signal travelling at the speed of light. No matter, energy or conventional information is
transferred, and the experiment is not regarded as a violation of relativity, but it is
demonstrated that quantum properties can correlate instantaneously over any distance.(see for
a basic introduction to QM: Thomas A, link internet.
The Failure of Modern Consciousness Studies
The study of consciousness was a taboo in academic circles through much of the 20th century,
at least in part due to the long reign of behaviorism. Even the study of emotion being largely
proscribed, with brains conceived as being reasoning machines and nothing else. This started
5

to lift in the late 1980s and at first this seemed to be a marvelous opportunity for the advances
made in other areas of science to be applied to the neglected area of consciousness. What
followed, however, can be seen as an overall negative in establishing orthodoxies which
appear to have negligible chance of success in explaining consciousness, while discouraging
explanations that relate to new areas of physics or neuroscience.
The traditional explanation for consciousness or the soul in more traditional language is
known as dualism. This posits a separate spirit stuff and physical stuff, with the spirit stuff
capable of acting on the physical stuff, as when the soul commands the body. The core
argument against dualism was that for the spirit stuff to act on the physicsal stuff it would
need to have some physically relevant quality and would therefore not be pure spirit stuff. V
ice versa looks to apply for physical stuff. The failure of dualism is one of the few points of
agreement between mainstream consciousness studies and those that identify consciousness
with a fundamental of the universe. (Thompson, 2000)
Functionalism was at least in the 1990s the dominant explanation for consciousness, driven by
the success of computers as problem solving and memory storage machines. The main
proposal is that any system or machine that processes information in the same way as the
brain will be conscious, regardless of what it is made of. The biological matter and structure of
the human brain was deemed irrelevant. In reality, and despite its popularity, this appears as a
pseudo-theory, kicking the problem of consciousness further down the road. It does not
explain how consciousness arises in the brain and nor does it explain how consciousness
might at some point arise in silicon or other matter. It seems, however, that functionalism has
had a malign effect in making mainstream consciousness studies practitioners think it unnecessary to take any notice of modern developments in neuroscience or biology.
Identity theory may have been the next most popular theory after functionalism in the 1990s.
This declared that consciousness was identical to the brain or identical to its processing.
However, it made little attempt to explain why it was identical to the brain, but not to any of
the other physical structures in the universe. Nor did it attempt to define what it meant by the
brain, despite the fact that our understanding of the physical processing of the brain was
changing dramatically. It was further undermined by the discovery that much neural
processing such as the dorsal stream governing spontaneous movement could be brought to
completion outside of consciousness, which was seen to be more closely related to longer-term
evaluations and planning.
Epiphenomenalism was and remains another popular idea. The theory proposes that
consciousness is a by-product of neural processing that has, however, no function. Despite its
popularity this concept is beset by at least three major problems. It conflicts with evolutionary
theory in that it is hard to see why evolution should select for something that had no function,
6

particularly as neural processing is exceptionally energy-hungry. The theory also conflicts
head on with physics in which there is no acausality, with every object or process having
influences elsewhere. Finally, there is the problem that even granting the idea of a functionless
by-product, there is still no physical evidence for what produces such a thing in the brain. Like
functionalism it appears to be a pseudo-theory.
In the present century, there seems to have been a tacit recognition that functionalism and
identity theory would have difficulty in becoming the consensus of a wider public. This
appears to have given rise to two more theories that avoid treating consciousness as a
fundamental. Consciousness resulting from embodiment has been possibly the most
fashionable of these ideas. Initially embodiment ideas did represent a genuine step forward in
both consciousness studies and psychology as a move away from the brain as a computer in a
vat. It now accepted that mental events could influence the body and that visceral events
could feed back on the brain. It also accepted that emotion is a relevant aspect of mental life.
However, there was an over-reach in suggesting that the body somehow drove consciousness
that the brain could not produce. This seemed to assume some kind of undefined special
property in the body that was not present in the brain. More specifically it ignored the fact
apart from the sense of touch, signals entered the brain directly from the environment and
were consciously processed in the higher sensory and frontal cortex before being signaled to
the viscera.
The attempt to classify consciousness as a form of information or information processing has
also become fashionable in this century. Interestingly, there are innumerable examples of nonconscious information, especially when we look at modern technology, with no apparent
specification as to how conscious information would differ from non-conscious information.
(Meijer, 2012, 2013a, 2014)
At a more philosophical level, there is a core difference between information and reality, in
that information embraces only what we happen to know, while it can also be defined as an
attempt to describe nature’s behavior and microscopic make up that comprises reality. Thus
the hunter-gatherer in ancient Africa, glancing up at the sun is only aware of its glare, heat and
position in the sky. A fuller understanding of its reality has to wait for modern science.
A popular but poorly based concept is to call consciousness an emergent property: The idea
of consciousness as an emergent property of classically described matter is superficially
plausible, and as such can sometimes look like the best shot of modern consciousness studies.
Emergence is a familiar process in physics. Thus liquidity is an emergent property of water.
The individual component hydrogen and oxygen atoms do not have the property of liquidity.
However, when they are bound together in a sufficiently large number of water molecules, the
property of liquidity emerges.
7

The problem for this as an explanation of consciousness is that when emergent properties such
as liquidity arise in nature, the emergence can be traced to the component particles and forces,
such as the electromagnetic interactions between the water molecules. The macroscopic
liquidity is an effect of the microscopic electrical charges and the resulting charge
relationships. The problem for consciousness as an emergent property is no arrangement of
such particles and forces has been identified that could produce consciousness. Many continue
to furiously assert that this is possible, but the claim being made here is in fact the same as
dualism, where two things that have no common property are required to act on one another.
Anybody who thinks this is possible in physics could simplify their search for consciousness
by accepting the idea of dualistic spirits (Murphy, 2007, 2011, Auletta et al, Clayton and
Davies, 2006 ).
In the last two decades, consciousness studies has gone off in a different direction from
physics or neuroscience. Much of consciousness studies is dominated by philosophers and
psychologists who have only a scant interest in what has been happening in brain science, let
alone physics. In many cases, they see it as their duty up to prop a nineteenth century
Newtonian world view, while dealing in abstractions that that take limited account of
neuroscience or physics. Neuroscientists have meanwhile been pressured into treating
consciousness as not part of their remit, deferring to philosophers when it was necessary to
discuss consciousness, even when the philosophy was contradicted by the neuroscientists own
discoveries. More fundamental approaches have fallen victim to black propaganda against
them. It seems likely that mainstream consciousness studies, if it survives at all, will reach the
end of the 21st century without having achieved consensus on a theory that has explanatory
value.
The Descent into the Quantum World
Suppose one were to ask for a scientific description of your hand. Biology could describe it in
terms of skin, bone, muscles, nerves, blood etc., and this might seem a completely satisfactory
description. However, if you were just a bit more curious, you might ask what the muscle and
blood etc. were made of. Here you would descend to a chemical explanation in terms of
molecules of protein, water etc. and the reactions and relations between these. If you were still
not satisfied with this, you would have to descend into the quantum world. At this level, the
solidity and continuity of matter dissolves. The molecules of protein etc. are made up of
atoms, but the atoms themselves are mainly vacuum. Most of the mass of the atom lies in a
small nucleus, comprised of protons and neutrons, which are themselves made up of smaller
particles known as quarks. The rest of the mass of the atom resides in a cloud of electrons
orbiting around the nucleus (see Fig.2).

8

Fig.2 : Some central elements of quantum physics: uncertainty of position of particles, wave / particle
duality as demonstrated in the double-slit experiment (upper part),as well as entanglement (nonlocality) of particles at great distances, the phenomenon of coherence/decoherence and superposition of
waves (lower part).

The fundamental particles are bound together by the four forces of nature, which are gravity,
electromagnetism and the strong and the weak nuclear forces. The strong nuclear force binds
together the particles in the nucleus of the atom, and acts only over the very short range of the
nucleus itself. Gravity is a long-range force that mediates the mutual attraction of all objects
possessing mass. The electromagnetic force is perhaps the force most apparent in everyday
life. We are familiar with it in the form of light, microwaves and X-rays. It holds together the
atom through the attraction of the opposite electrical charges of the electron and the proton. It
also governs the interactions between molecules. Van der Waals forces, a weak form of the
electromagnetic force is vital to the conformation of protein and thus to the process of life
itself. In contrast to the nuclear forces, gravity and electromagnetism are conceived of as
extending over infinite distance, but with their strength diminishing according to the inverse
square law. That is, if you double your distance from an object, its gravitational attraction will
be four times as weak. The quanta can be divided into two main classes, the fermions, which
possess mass and the bosons which convey energy or the forces of nature. The most
fundamental fermions are the quarks making up the nucleus and the circling electrons, while
gluons and photons are the most prominent bosons. The gravitons, which may intermediate
the gravitational force remain hypothetical.

9

The Quantum Wave
The quantum particles or quanta are unlike any particles or objects that are encountered in the
large scale world. When isolated from their environment they are conceived as having the
property of waves, but when they are brought into contact with the environment, there is a
process of decoherence, in which the wave function is described as collapsing into a particle.
The wave form of the quanta is different from waves in matter in the large scale world, such as
the familiar waves in the sea. These involve energy passing through matter. By contrast, the
quantum wave can be viewed as a wave of the probability for finding a particle in a specific
position. This probability wave also applies to states of the quanta such as momentum. While
the quanta remains in its wave form, it is viewed as a superposition of all the possible
positions that the particle could occupy. At the peak of the wave, where the amplitude is
greatest, there is the highest probability of finding a particle, when the wave eventually
collapses. However, the choice of position for each individual particle is completely random,
representing an effect without a cause. This comprises the first serious conceptual problem in
quantum theory.
The Two-Slit Experiment in Quantum Mechanics
The physicist Richard Feynman said that this classic experiment contained all the problems of
quantum theory. In the early nineteenth century, an experiment by Thomas Young showed
that when a light source shone through two slits in a screen, and then onto a further screen,
then a pattern of light and dark bands appeared on a further screen, indicating that the light
was in some places intensified and in other reduced or eliminated. Where two waves of
ordinary matter, for instances waves in water, come into contact an interference pattern forms,
by which the waves are either doubled in size or cancelled out. This appearance of this
phenomenon in Young’s experiment demonstrated that light was a wave, contrary to most
scientific opinion prior to the experiment.
Later, the experiment was refined. It could now be performed with one or two slits open. If
there was only one slit open, the photons or light quanta, or any other quanta used in the
experiment behaved like particles. They passed through the one open slit, interacted with the
screen beyond and left an accumulation of marks on that screen, signifying a shower of
particles rather than a wave. But once the second slit was opened, the traditional interference
pattern, indicating interaction between two waves, reappeared on the screen. The ability to
generate the behavior of either particles or waves, simply according to how the experiment
was set up, showed that the quanta had a perplexing wave/particle duality.

10

Fig. 3: The famous double slit experiment: single particles behave like a wave front that show
interference pattern on the screen (a), even after passing the two slits decisions to open or close a slit
influences the final pattern (b).

The wave/particle duality was shocking enough, but there was worse to come. Technology
advanced to the point where photons could be emitted one at a time, and therefore impacted
the screen one at a time (Fig. 3). What is remarkable is that with two slits open, but the
photons impacting one at a time, the pattern on the screen formed itself into the light and dark
bands of an interference pattern. Somehow the photons ‘knew’ to arrange themselves into a
pattern indicative on the interaction of waves. The question arose as to how the photons
emitted later in time ‘knew’ how to arrange themselves relative to the earlier photons in such a
way that there was a pattern of light and dark bands, indicative of interacting waves.
The obvious solution was to place photon counters at the two slits in order to monitor what
the photons were up to. However, as soon as a photon is registered by a counter, it collapses
from being a wave into being a particle, and the wave related interference pattern is lost from
the further screen. The most plausible way to look at it may be to say that the wave of the
photon passes through both slits, or possibly that it tries out both routes, and after doing this
the divided wave interferes with itself ( see Fig. 3).
The EPR Experiment and the Copenhagen Interpretation
Einstein disliked the inherent randomness involved in the collapse of the wave function. This
was despite the fact that his revival of the idea of light in the form of discrete particles or
quanta had contributed to the foundation of quantum theory. He sought repeatedly to show
that quantum theory was flawed, and in 1935 he seemed to have produced a masterstroke in
11

the form of the EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen) experiment. At the time this was only a
‘thought experiement’, a mental simulation of how a real experiment might proceed, but since
1982 it has been possible to perform this as a real experiment (Fig.4).

Fig.4: Quantum entanglement in a pair of distant elementary particles with regard to spin

The challenge to quantum theory presented by the EPR experiment hinges on the concepts of
locality and non-locality. Locality comprises the idea of normal cause and effect under which
objects or particles move or change as a result of being impacted by other objects or particles,
or of being directly acted on by energetic forces such as the electromagnetic force. It is local
because the object or force producing the action or change has to be in direct contact with the
object or particle acted on. Moreover, where a force emitted by one object acts on another
distant object such as light emitted from the Sun acting on the Earth, the force passes between
the two objects at a speed not greater than that of light. By contrast, non-locality involves the
ability of one particle to determine the behaviour of another distant particle instantaneously,
and without any matter or energy passing between the two. Einstein termed this ‘spooky
action at a distance’.
With the EPR experiment it was shown, that as it stood, quantum theory violated the principle
of locality, which is normally regarded as basic to scientific thinking and even to common
sense. Quantum theory indicated that when two quanta had been closely related to one
another, for instance in the same electron orbital, they could be regarded as quantum
entangled. In this state, certain aspects of their behavior in relation to one another became
12

fixed. For instance, quantum particles have a property of spin, which is partly analogous to the
spinning of large-scale objects. Quanta can have the property of spin-up or spin-down. In an
entangled state particles could have the relationship that when one had spin up, the other
would always have spin down. However, as quanta, while they remained in a wave form,
they both represented a superposition of spin-up and spin-down, and therefore neither of
them had a defined spin (Fig. 4).
The EPR experiment proposed that two such wave-form particles are moved apart. This could
be a few meters along a laboratory bench or to the other side of the universe. The relevant
consideration is that the two locations should be out-of-range of a signal travelling at the
speed of light. Now, if an observation is made on one of the particles, its wave function
collapses, and it acquires a defined spin, let’s say spin-up in this case. Now when an
observation is made on the other particle, it will always be found to have the opposite spin.
This defies the normal expectation of classical physics that a random choice of spin would
produce approximately 50% the same spin and 50% different. Therefore, there is seen to be
some non-local connection between the two particles, although it is not possible to describe or
detect this in terms of a normal physical transfer of energy or matter. This non-locality and the
randomness of the outcome of the wave function collapse constitute the two main puzzles in
quantum theory.
The Copenhagen interpretation and the EPR Experiment
The idea of non-locality, which appeared to deny much of what the science of the previous
three hundred years had been trying to establish, was as repugnant to the leaders of the
quantum movement, such as Neils Bohr, as it was to Einstein as an opponent of quantum
indeterminism. Some modern analysis suggests that Bohr changed his own view of the
quantum world in a crucial manner after encountering the EPR challenge. Bohr’s
interpretation is known as the Copenhagen Interpretation, and the form of this that emerged
after 1935 essentially denied the objective existence or reality of the quantum wave. Bohr said
that there was no quantum world, there was no deep reality. The quanta only achieved
objective reality when they were the subject of an experiment or observation (Interpretations
of quantum mechanics, Wikipedia; Genovese, 2010).
The concept of reality or objective existence is here taken to mean that something exists even
when it is not being observed by anyone. The Copenhagen Interpretation denies that sort of
reality to the wave form of the quanta. The wave was to be seen only as an abstract
mathematical expression allowing one to predict the probable position of a particle. If the
wave form had no real existence, EPR type situations did not involve any physical action at a
distance, and the problem could be deemed to have gone away,( see Kumar M ,2009).

13

The Aspect Experiment and Non-locality

Alain Aspect
The question returned to the fore in the 1980′s as technology overtook the original EPR
thought experiment. In 1969 John Bell’s Theorem had shown mathematically how EPR could
be tested, and in 1982, (Alain Aspect, 1982). Aspect’s experiment demonstrated the physical
reality of EPR. The Aspect experiment did not invalidate Copenhagen, but it transferred the
whole debate from the hypothetical to the scientifically tested level. It presented physics with
a stark choice. Either one could accept the Copenhagen Interpretation in which the locality of
interactions was preserved, but the components of matter and energy were unreal, or one
could have a world that was real, but in part governed by non-local influences, Einstein’s
dreaded ‘spooky action at a distance’.
In fact, recent decades have seen a growing challenge to the orthodoxy of Copenhagen. This
leaves us without a generally agreed interpretation of quantum theory. The Copenhagan
Interpretation preserved us from non-locality, but the concept of the quanta as mathematical
abstractions that suddenly produced physical particles may be viewed as troubling. It seems
to propose a sort of dualism, comparable to the relationship between spirit stuff and physical
stuff. How could mental constructs, such as mathematical formula, become physcial without
having had some physical reality in the first place.
Other interpretations have come more to the fore in recent decades. Decoherence has become
particularly popular as a substitute for the traditional ‘measurement’ always referred to in the
Copenhagen version. In decoherence, the collapse of the wave function happens of its own
accord, as a result of the wave becoming entangled with the rest of the environment. In some
recent versions, it is suggested that there is no collapse, the information in the wave simply
gets lost in the larger scale environment. In some quarters, this is argued to provide a
connection to the ‘Many Worlds’ interpretation. In this, there is also no collapse, but a
branching of reality into separate universes. So in the Schrodinger cat paradox, for instance,
the universe splits into one universe with a live cat and one with a dead cat.

14

Quantum Gravity and the Search for Reality
The success of quantum theory (see examples in Fig. 5), which describes matter and energy,
and of relativity, which describes space and time, have both been marred by the
incompatibility of these two key theories. Relativity describes gravity as the smooth,
continuous curvature of space under the influence of massive objects, while quantum theory is
based on the idea of energy and matter coming in discreet discontinuous units.
Mathematically these contrasting features lead to infinities, indicating that something is
wrong. The attempt to overcome these problems has led to new theories, such as string theory,
and loop quantum gravity (Smollin, 2005).

Fig. 5: Wave/ particle duality in Quantum physics should be rather seen as a state in which a particle
and wave forms are complementary features in an hidden reality (up left), and Pusey et al showed
that the wave form is a physical reality (middle left). Principles of Quantum physics are presently
used in a large variety of technologies (up right). The conscious observer or a detector that observes
the double slit system and provides interpretable data collapses the wave function to a single slit
pattern.

String theory proposes that the fundamental particles are not point particles, as had been
assumed, but one-dimensional strings extending into higher dimensions, beyond the normal
four dimensions. The extra dimensions are usually deemed to have been rolled up very small
in the Big Bang, which accounts for them never having been detected. The manner in which
the strings vibrate determines the nature of the particle involved. The analogy is that of the
strings of a violin, where the vibration of the string determines the nature of the note. While
15

this may appear both speculative and improbable, it has the advantage of being described by
mathematics that would allow quantum theory and relativity to be compatible (see String
Theory; M-theory in Wikipedia ).
The two main criticisms of string theory are that it produces 10^500 possible universes, and
that it operates against the background of a fixed spacetime, a concept that relativity showed
to be invalid. An alternative approach is provided by loop quantum gravity (LQG). This
approaches the problem from the direction of relativity and concepts of spacetime, in contrast
to string theory, which approaches from the the point of view of particles and quantum theory
(Smolin, 2004).
LQG proposes that spacetime is quantized or in discrete units. Spacetime is suggested to be
created out of a network, or a lattice, or a series of loops. This theory has drawn on the earlier
spin network theory developed by Roger Penrose (1994, 2004), and moves towards viewing
particles and spacetime as dual aspects of the same thing.
Problems and Opportunities in Quantum Theory
We have emphasized three problematic aspects of the theory, a causality in the randomness of
the wave function collapse, a causality in the non-local influences demonstrated by EPR type
experiments, and the resulting lack of agreement as to the underlying reality of the physical
universe. At the quantum level, we find properties of mass, charge and spin that are given
properties of the universe lacking cause or explanation. If we ask, what is the charge on the
electron, what is it, not what does it do, the answer will be a resounding silence. The quanta
and related spacetime appear to be the only level of the physical universe where it might be
possible for science to insert consciousness as an additional fundamental property, (see for
reviews Vannini and Di Corpo, 2008, Hu and Wu, 2010, and Tarlaci, 2010, Meijer and Korf,
2013, Pereira, 2003 Atmanspacher, 2011).
Timescales for Neural Processes and Consciousness
In looking at the possible physical underpinnings of neuroscience, Georgiev contrasts what is
for consciousness studies the still dominant Newtonian orthodoxy of deterministic causes and
effects, with quantum physics, in which there is a multitude of potential outcomes, rather than
a single determined outcome. Georgiev, 2003 discusses epiphenomenalism, the theory that
consciousness is a by-product of brain processing having only an illusion of causal influence.
He points out the evolutionary argument against this view, to the effect that evolution would
not select for something that conveyed no selective advantage. In general, he sees the idea that
we have no freedom or moral responsibility as counterintuitive. Such a counterintuitive result
is seen as the inevitable consequence of explanations based on deterministic classical physics.
16

Quantum mechanics does, however, provide a non-deterministic alternative, in which
consciousness underlies the neural processes of making choices and thus effecting future
possibilities. The author goes on to discuss the vexed question of the possibility of quantum
coherence in the brain. Mainstream consciousness studies has managed to fabricate an
orthodoxy, to the effect that quantum coherence cannot occur in organic matter. A paper by
the physicist, Max Tegmark, is often quoted in this respect. Tegmark asserted what was
already an established position, to the effect that quantum coherence in the brain would be too
short lived to have a functional role in neural processing( Tegmark, 2000).

Max Tegmark
Tegmark’s paper was aimed at refuting Hameroff’s Orch OR theory, (Hameroff and Penrose,
2011) which required quantum coherence to be sustained for 25 ms. Thus Tegmark did not
show that coherence over shorter timescales could not support consciousness, because he was
directing his argument at the longer timescales of Hameroff’s theory. Georgiev here queries
whether there is any evidence that consciousness has to arise over a milliseconds timescale. If
consciousness could operate over a picosecond or shorter timescale then Tegmark’s
calculations do not present any problem for quantum consciousness. It is pointed out that all
neuroscience has been able to show to date is that consciousness does not operate on a scale
slower than milliseconds.
Tests show that there is a minimum timescale of about 30 ms needed for a subject to
distinguish two sensory inputs as being separate. This means that consciousness cannot be
slower than 30 ms. However, patients with time agnosia, who have subjective experience of
the passage of time, confirm that it is physically possible to have consecutive conscious steps
that are experienced as simultaneous. From this it is argued that the real units of consciousness
could be at the picoseconds level, although such units cannot be discerned by the conscious
subject.
It is argued here that the upper possible bound of the timescale of consciousness need not be
its actual scale. As an analogy, Georgiev takes the example of the operation of a personal
computer. The computer screen is on a millisecond timescale with the screen refreshing
perhaps every 10 ms. But this is not indicative of the performance of the processor, which may
17

operate on a picoseconds timescale. All that the refresh rate of the monitor can tell us that the
processor does not operate on a slower than 10 ms timescale. In the brain, the millisecond
timescale applies to the brain’s communications with sensory organs and muscles, but this
may not say much about its internal processing.
The author goes on to argue that if consciousness arises at the quantum level some of the
conventional arguments of mainstream consciousness theory fail. He contrasts classical and
quantum information. Classical information can be copied and stored. A DVD encoded on a
string of 0′s and 1′s, which can be read by an external observer, is an example of classical
information. With the qbits of quantum information, it is impossible to read them because any
interaction with them would alter them. All that can be done is to swap or move the
information without deleting it. This inability for third parties to observe quantum
information is similar to our inability to observe first person consciousness, while in contrast
such inability is alien to classical information systems.
The author argues that it is impossible to copy minds that are based on quantum states
because of the no-cloning theorem, which demonstrates that attempts to copy quanta result in
the quanta being corrupted. In mainstream consciousness studies, philosophers and others
have sought to create wonderment by arguing that it is possible to copy minds, and this
appears to be true in principle, if consciousness is based on classical physics. However, if
conscious arises from quantum states this becomes impossible. The possibility of copying a
mind has also been used as a somewhat convoluted argument against the existence of the self,

because in this argument copying the mind would create the paradox of two identical selves.
However if copying of minds is impossible this paradox will not arise.

QM approaches in neurobiology: the state of art
The following section, taken from Meijer and Korf, 2013, discusses the idea that the physical
quantum concepts do physically apply to the mind: the mental domain is considered as an
aspect of wave information. A special position takes the feature of superposition: quantum
particles can be present in multiple spatial locations or states and be described by one or more
pure state wave functions simultaneously of which a single state can finally be selected.
Penrose, (1989) suggested that the underlying space /time geometry in fact bifurcates during
the superposition process and wave collapse occurs in a non-computable manner. It was
suggested the conditions found in the microtubule could allow coherent quantum particles to
form a unity that can be described by a single wave function. These concepts are considered
the ”hard quantum theories”, as opposed to the “soft” or formal theories of the previous
section. QM adherents refer often to Wolfgang Pauli (Pauli, 1994), the eminent quantum
scientist who suggested that the mental and the material domain are governed by common
ordering principles, and should be understood as “complementary aspects of the same reality”
(see Atmansapacher and Primas, 1977; Primas 2003). The “hard” mental QM theories apply
either to specific brain structures/molecules (this section) or to quantum fields and
dimensions or both.
Vannini and Di Corpo, 2008, Hu and Wu, 2010, and Tarlaci, 2010 listed and attempted to
categorize the various published quantum brain models, without a detailed treatment of the
individual models. Vannini and Di Corpo distinguish models based on consciousness creating
reality, models based on probability aspects of QM and models based on already established
QM order principles. Hu and Wu differentiate in models based on QM elements of
entanglement and coherence and models on the relation of QM with consciousness that can
include materialistic modes (consciousness emerges from material brain), dualistic
mind/matter models and panpsychistic modes. The first two papers emphasize the potential
testability of the various models. More detailed reviews can be found in Pereira, 2003 and
Tuszynsky and Woolf, 2010, the latter as an introductory chapter of the instructive book:
“Emerging Physics of Consciousness”, while an excellent and critical overview of the field is
provided by Atmanspacher, 2011.
A number of, more or less specific, scientific journals are currently, or were, devoted to this
subject: NeuroQuantology, Quantum Biosystems, Mind and Matter, and AntiMatters.
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (see quantum mechanics and quantum theory) also
provides an excellent reference. Additional publications on the topic can be found in: J

and Behavior Physics of Life Reviews, Syntropy Journal, Biological Cybernetics and
Kybernetik. The Journal of Consciousness Studies is an excellent source for various models for
consciousness (see for example Fig. 6).

Fig. 6: Some models that have been proposed for human consciousness
Before we delve into the physical aspects of the quantum brain, a number of common
misunderstandings on QM modeling should be dealt with:

There is no single theory on quantum mechanical aspects of brain function. In fact a
spectrum of more or less independent models have been proposed, that all have their intrinsic
potential and problems (see table 2, for references see the above mentioned reviews and
Meijer, 2012, Meijer and Korf, 2013).

In spite of the introduction, already in the first part of the 20 th century and the
spectacular successes of the theory ever since, some still see quantum physics as a sort of
esoteric part of science. However it rather represents a revolutionary refinement of classical
21

physics, for example taking into account that the theory was required in order to build an
adequate atomic model and more recently to explain experimentally demonstrated
teleportation of particles (see Zeilinger, 2000) as well as principles of downward causation
(Wheeler, 2002) and time symmetry (see Aharonov et al, 2010). It is also the basis for laser,
semi- and super- conductance, and microchip technology as well as MRI brain scanning
(Marcer and Schempp, 1997). It should also be kept in mind that classical physics can be fully
derived from quantum physics, not the other way around.

Quantum physics is, by some rejected, since so many interpretations of the theory are at
stake (Copenhagen, Many worlds, Implicate order, Interactional theory, Micro- macro- scale
definition, Environmental de-coherence, Relational quantum mechanics etc.). Yet a number of
common elements such as the true particle/wave aspect, instead of only a probability
function, (Pusey et al., 2012), superposition, entanglement/non-locality and coherence/decoherence phenomena are experimentally established and remain very usable in practice,
although the related semantics should be carefully defined.

It is often stated that quantum wave information coherence cannot be maintained long
enough in the brain due to interaction with the macro-environment of the brain components.
Yet, on this point major differences in decoherence-time calculations exist, as based on various
models and their intrinsic assumptions (see Hagan et al., 2002 and Tegmark, 2000, Lloyd,
2011). A central point here is that sub-compartments could be present at the molecular or submolecular level, that by their special arrangements are quantum noise protected or coherence
stabilized. Examples are internal parts of channel proteins (Bernroider, 2004), and stabilization
by clustered (gel/sol) arrangements of cytoplasmic water clusters (see Hameroff and Penrose,
1996, Penrose and Hameroff, 2011). The latter authors proposed a hierarchic model
encompassing nerve cell depolarization, gel/sol transitions of resulting in disconnection of
microtubuli, shape/volume pulsation of dendrites including reorganization of synaptic
contacts and finally sol/gel transition stabilizing a new state. Through coherence and
macroscopic entanglement, life time of wave information can be much longer than in the
classical phase, as a consequence of coherence/decoherence dynamic equilibria, allowing
nonlocal remote interaction in large numbers of entangled neurons. Such gel/sol oscillations
could even be a primary to excitation/depolarization triggered by normal sensory stimuli and
are supposed to interact with zero-point vacuum dipole vibrations (the bi-vacuum matrix
model of Kaivairanen, 2006).

It should be realized that decoherence, does not, per definition imply destruction of
information since, firstly, it is not compatible with the quantum principles of non-cloning and
non-deletion, secondly a cyclic process of decoherence and re-coherence processes cannot be
excluded (see Hartmann, et al 2006; Li and Paraoano (2009); Atmanspacher, 2011) while
thirdly, even if such decoherence does occur, it may result in mixture of possibilities that may
be accommodated by the collection of perceivable worlds in the brain (Stapp, 2012). It has
been proposed by Vattay and Kauffman, 2012, that a decoherent state can be converted back
22

to a coherent state by the input of adequate phase and amplitude information. The resulting
coherent states can last long enough in warm biological systems in order to, for example,
enable coherent search processes for antenna-mediated transport of photon energy in
photosynthesis. The author postulates that similar “poised realm” or micro-domains, on the
edge of chaos, could also be instrumental in the human brain as sites where a dynamic
interplay of decoherence and re-coherence takes place.

It is often assumed that QM is only valid for a description of nature on the micro-scale
(elementary particles etc.). Yet convincing evidence was more recently presented that
quantum physics can be applied to macromolecules (Zeilinger, 2000), and to the surprise of
many, even can occur in warm and wet biological systems (photosynthesis: Engel et al., 2010)
and brains of birds in relation to magnetic sensing and navigation (for references see Arndt et
al., 2009, Lloyd, 2011), see Fig. 7.

Fig 7: Quantum phenomena that have been detected at the life macro-scale

Lloyd concluded: “Quantum coherence plays a strong role in photosynthetic energy
transport, and may also play a role in the avian compass and sense of smell. In retrospect, it
should come as no surprise that quantum coherence enters into biology. Biological processes
are based on chemistry, and chemistry is based on quantum mechanics. If an organism can
attain an advantage in reproduction, however slight, by putting quantum coherence to use,
then over time natural selection has a chance to engineer the necessary biochemical
mechanisms to exploit that coherence. Different types of quantum processes that operate at the
23

same time scale can interact strongly either to assist or to impede one another. In
photosynthetic energy transfer, the convergence of quantum time scales gives rise to more
efficient and robust transport. Evolved biological systems exhibit the quantum Goldilocks
effect: natural selection pushes together time scales to allow quantum processes to help each
other out”.

A spectrum of atoms/molecules has been suggested to operate in a quantum manner:
Ca 2+- and K+- ions, H2O, enzymes, membrane receptor and channel proteins, membrane
lipids, neurotransmitter molecules, in addition to macromolecular structures such as
DNA/RNA, gap junctions, pre-synaptic vesicles, microtubules and micro-filaments
(Tuszinsky and Woolf, 2010, Meijer, 2014)

Since our integral universe can be described by the current laws of QM and relativity, it
does not seem warranted to place the human brain outside nature: some see even cosmic
architecture mirrored in our complex brain (Kak, 2009; Amoroso, 2003)

The discussion around higher brain functions is frequently obscured by modalities of
promissory materialism: “at present we do not understand consciousness but within 20 years
the problem will be resolved !” Not only is such an extrapolation scientifically unwarranted
but certainly cannot be falsified. Even more damaging is the assumption that one will find the
solution by further using current technology, instead of postulating new (for example
quantum) models and innovative experimental approaches.

Some QM models are based on the interaction of brain components with experimentally
detected quantum fields (Yasue and Jibu 1995, Vitiello, 1995, Pessa and Vitiello, 2003). The
central aspects of realistic quantum field theory hold that the essence of material reality is a set
of fields. These fields obey the principles of special relatively and quantum theory and the
intensity of a field at a point gives the probability for finding its associated quanta as the
fundamental particles that are observed by experimentalists. These fields may holographically
project into each other, implying interactions/interpenetrations of their associated quantum
waves. Vitiello proposes a virtual shadow brain working in a time-reversed mode that
stabilizes coherence and neural memory structures.

It could be worthwhile to project neo-darwinism and its biological evolution theories
against the canvas of potential QM mechanisms, in the sense that parallel quantum
superpositions and backward causation mechanisms can provide explanations and/or
alternatives for evolution jumps and so-called emergent phenomena (see Davies, 2004;
Murphy, 2011; Auletta et al., 2008 Davies and Gregersen, 2010; Ellis, 2005; Vattay et al 2012).
Recently, models were proposed for the transfer of information in biological evolution on the
basis of quantum formalisms (Bianconi and Rahmede, 2012, Djordjevic, 2012).

On the basis of QM concepts one should be prepared to envision uncommon and even
utterly strange manifestations of quantum entanglement: certain transpersonal human
experiences (Kak, 2009; Radin and Nelson 2006; Di Biase, 2009 a, b, Jahn and Dunne, 2007)
should not be seen as potentially be explained by QM, but rather required (Radin and Nelson,
24

2006) by the concept that our world is part of a quantum universe (Vedral, 2010; Lloyd, 2006;
Barrow and Tippler, 1986).
QM and Higher Brain Functions
Here we discuss current QM theories as possible theories bridging the classical neuronal and
mental concepts. QM theories does indeed apply to the same brain physiological phenomena,
but introduce also typical features such as particle/wave duality, entanglement and nonlocality, as well as wave interference and superposition. In addition processes such as
quantum coherence and resonance of wave interactions are at stake.

Table 2: Quantum Brain Models proposed from 1960 and further (see for references Meijer, 2012; Meijer
and Korf, 2013; Meijer, 2014; Vannini and Di Corpo, 2008; Hu and Wu, 2010, and Tarlaci, 2010).

It is not our purpose to assess the various QM theories in detail, rather we intend to discuss
some of their major implications regarding the concept of a “quantum brain”. The key position
of proteins in the quantum-mediated initiation and execution of mental activities was already
emphasized. Several QM theories are based on specific properties of proteins, as for instance
micro-tubular proteins, (Penrose, 1989; Hameroff, 2007), proteins involved in facilitating
25

synaptic transmission (e.g. Beck and Eccles 1992; Beck 2001), including Ca2+- channels, see
Stapp, 2009), as well as specific channel proteins, instrumental in the initiation and
propagation of action potentials (K+- channels), Bernroider and Roy, 2004), see Fig 8.
QM theories also extends the mind to different spaces and time dimensions and some consider
the individual mind (partly) as an expression of a universal mind through holonomic
communication with quantum fields. In the latter approach, the human brain is conceived as
an interfacing organ that not only produces mind and consciousness but also receives
information necessary for full deployment of these mental phenomena (see next session). The
central question here is whether neuronal cells are the sole units for information processing in
the brain rather than sub-cellular organelles or molecules (Schwarz et al., 2004).

Fig 8. Some aspects of quantum brain models: Synaptic transmission by vesicular exocytosis of
neurotransmitter molecules, Ca2+ -influx via Ca2+- channel protein in the neuronal membrane
facilitates fusion of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. The fusion of sufficient vesicles
leads to transmitter release and depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, this fusion process
bears a quantum probability character.

A major debate about these theories concerns the possibility of coherent quantum states in the
“warm” and wet internal milieu of the brain. (see e.g. Atmanspacher, 2011). The defenders of
the quantum brain models have argued that in vivo molecular configurations exist that enable
the modulation of quantum states through efficient protection and shielding of the wave
interaction compartments in the cells (Hagan et al., 2002).
26

The particular local collapse of the wave function, in this manner, produces new information.
As originally proposed by Eccles, this is realized by membrane protein induced fluxes of Ca2+
or K+ ions, that than increase the probability of fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles in the
synapses, leading to the firing of the particular neuron or even groups of neurons. The central
hypothesis here is that synaptic transmission represents a typical (quantum) probability state
in which the total number of vesicles available for exocytosis is critical for an all or none
response of neuronal firing (Beck and Eccles, 1992; Beck, 2001). Coherent neuronal
perturbations and especially their entangled state are supposed to provide non-local
“binding” of sensory and cognitive brain centers, and may also enable perception of qualia
and the unitary sense of “conscious self” (Hameroff, 2007). As the "mesoscopic" scale of brain
activity where the "binding" process is expected to occur is in the vicinity of the quantum
domain, the binding principle is likely to be a quantum non-local effect, probably the only
known physical mechanism able of performing such a task. One possibility is the formation of
a quantum photonic field (Flanagan, 2006); another possibility is the formation of coherent
states on the level of trans-membrane ion fluxes such as that of Ca2+ as suggested by Pereira,
2003, 2007, see section 8, Fig. 8).
Hameroff and Penrose (2011, see later) argue against mechanisms of all-or-none firing of
axonal potentials as suggested by Beck and Eccles, since such binary states do not include nonlinear and not computable characteristics of consciousness. They rather prefer the model of
Davia, 2010 (see the chapter in the book edited by Tuszinski and Woolf, 2010), proposing that
consciousness is related to traveling waves in the brain as a uniting life principle on multiple
scales. The latter is based on energy dissipation, enzyme catalysis, protein folding that
maintains energy balance in an excitable system such as the brain, conditions that are also
compatible with the isoenergetic brain model treated in Meijer and Korf, 2013. Non-linearity
in brain processes is modeled using the well-known Schrödinger equation, adjusted with a
non-linear term, as proposed earlier by Walker (see Behera, 2010 in the same book), by which
robustness of a classical approach is combined with the more flexible elements of quantum
theory.
The originators of this hypothesis (Penrose, 1989; Hameroff, 2007) have discussed that
microtubule, in principle, can maintain quantum states (i.e. superposition) lasting at least 10 -6
seconds, long enough to be instrumental in the transfer of quantum wave information. Such
lasting quantum states are possible because of the shielding of hydrophobic pockets in the
particular proteins, as well as the formation of coherent clusters of these molecules that
thereby share a common quantum wave function (so called Bose-Einstein Condensates).There
is indirect evidence that microtubules may be relevant for neurocognition: increased synthesis
in relation to postnatal development with regard to synaptogenesis and visual learning and as
counterpart aging deficits in memory as well as interactions with general anesthetics (Penrose
27

and Hameroff, 2011, 2012; Tuszynski and Woolf, 2010; Kalvairainen, 2005). Yet such
correlative studies should not only be further substantiated with experiments that show
quantum states in isolated tubules, as reported by (Bandyopadhyay, 2011), but rather and
most importantly, directly demonstrate tubular involvement in higher brain functions in situ.
More recently in 2013 Bandyopadhyay’s group demonstrated that in microtubules the energy
level of up to 40,000 individual tubulin proteins and the energy level of the microtubule are
the same. The water core and the individual tubulin proteins are suggested to control the
properties of the microtubule by means of delocalised electromagnetic oscillations. The
properties of the microtubule might be taken to suggest that the system can support a
macroscopic quantum state. The authors say that prior to this 2013 paper the properties of
tubulin and microtubules were not extensively studies using the up-to-date technologies
mentioned here. Theories that apply to metals, insulators and semi-conductors are not relevant
to microtubules.
In conclusion: tubular and synaptic channel proteins exhibit conformational transitions within
10-9 seconds that may last for 10-6 seconds or even longer, (Beck and Eccles 1992; Beck 2001;
Bernroider and Roy, 2004, Kaivairainen, 2005). These perturbations may last long enough to
be finally detected as miniature neuronal potentials (Hamill et al., 1981, Hagan et al., 2002).
The particular mechanisms also imply a manifestation of non-local quantum effects due to
distant coherence, a phenomenon that was even recorded in laser stimulated neuronal cell
cultures in which classical physical explanations were excluded (Pizzi et al., 2004).
The coherence of such quantum states among brain proteins has been suggested to lead to
material changes in brain physiology through orchestrated collapse of quantum coherent
clusters of tubulin proteins, triggered by quantum gravity expressed at the spin (Planck scale)
level. On the basis of a recent theory on the nature of gravity (Verlinde, 2011), postulating that
gravity is not a force but rather an entropic compensation for the movement of
mass/information, it was speculated that consciousness may arise from a gravity-mediated
reaction on the entropic displacement of information as it occurs in high density in the human
brain (Meijer, 2012).
Anyhow, there should be a mechanism to integrate signal processing within a single neuron
with other, even distant, neurons and consequently non-local effects due to quantum
entanglement should play a role also in this case. These quantum processes may explain
phenomena such as qualia, meaning, sensation of unity, intentionality as well as conflict
solving, reliability in the sense of correspondence with the outer world and the sense of self.
The latter is related to the feeling of causal power that could result from a quantum/classical
interface in which classical synaptic processes create a quantum coherent state that enables
quantum computation that exert a back-influence on the original synaptic process (Pereira,
2003, 2007). The existence of nonlocality in brain function, being a basic property of the
28

universe strongly argues for an underlying deep reality out of space/time as originally
proposed by Bohm (1990) in the form of an implicate order. Bohm claimed that these
mechanisms also play a role in different forms of transpersonal and extrasensory perception
by wave resonance with an universal quantum field (Kak, 2009, Jahn and Dunne, 2007,
Kafatos and Draganescu, 2000, Kafatos, 2009).
The main issue of the present essay is that wave information provides a potential coupling to
mental processes. For instance, wave information could be transmitted from and into the brain
by wave resonance and may locally collapse to matter entities through conscious observation,
including sufficient individual attention and intention (Stapp, 2009). Stapp (2012) argued
recently that this does not represent an interference effect between superposed states, as
assumed by Hameroff and Penrose (1996), but that through environmental de-coherence,
superpositions will be converted to multiple mixtures of information. Since our brain contains
a large collection of perceivable worlds, it is able by supercausal free choice and subsequent
common random choice to make a fit with one or more of the abovementioned mixed
information modalities. The particular waves than spread out and rapid sequence repetitions
(the so called Zeno effect) may sufficiently maintain coherence in parts of the brain. Of note,
Stapp does not see free will as based on quantum probability aspects. He states: “In the
original Copenhagen formulation this extra process is initiated by what is called “A free choice
on the part of the experimenter.” The phrase “free choice” emphasizes the fact that, while a
definite particular choice is needed, this choice is not determined by any known law or rule:
The purely physical aspects of the theory have, therefore a significant causal gap, which opens
the door to a possible causal input from the mentally side of reality”.
Quantum information may exert physical effects via a bottom-up flow of information starting
at spin networks (Penrose, 1994; Hu and Wu, 2010), that can be passed on as wave forms of
elementary particles/atoms, to be ultimately expressed at the level of neuronal molecules.
Meijer and Korf, 2013, consider the latter flow of information more feasible than being
directly transferred through vibratory interference at the molecular level. According to this
integral quantum model, perturbations at the various spatiotemporal domains allow both
time-symmetric forward and backward causation and therefore top-down influence of
quantum fields).
The basic question is: how are quantum waves or quantum fields finally perceived by the
human brain and how they influence or even induce phenomena as (self)consciousness?
Organisms do indeed visually perceive photons that exhibit wave/particle duality; humans
even sense less than ten photons, whereas insects may even detect a single photon (Baylor et
al., 1979; Menini et al., 1995). Sensitive detection is possible with dedicated cellular structures
as for instance in the mammalian retina that amplify the energy of a single photon by a
cascade of processes, based on changes of protein conformations and cellular potential energy,
29

leading to the electrochemical stimulation of neurons projecting to the brain. Recently,
photosensitive proteins have been coupled to ion-channel proteins with biotechnical
techniques, so that the neural activity can be modified or inhibited in vivo by light introduced
via optic microfibers (Lima and Miesenböck, 2005; Boyden et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2009).
These experimental approaches demonstrate that quantum effects may directly affect neural
function, but it remains to be shown more definitely, that this also does occur directly inside
the human brain as it was demonstrated in the brain of birds (see the reviews of Arndt et al.,
2009, Lloyd, 2011).
Quantum information mechanisms were recently used to model human consciousness as well
as the unconscious in relation to conscious perception (Martin et al, 2013) in which various
modalities of non-locality were discussed. Of note, entanglement and non-localty may not
only apply to spatial separation but also a temporal one (Megidish et al, 2012). It was
proposed by Martin that archetypes can be stored as quantum systems and that consciousness
may be controlled by quantum entanglement from outside space-time. Although this cannot be
easily envisioned, Nicolescu (1992, 2011) made clear that the relation between different levels
of reality have to be interpreted in the framework of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, and
that it may be intrinsically impossible to construct a complete theory for describing the unity
of all levels of reality. Interestingly, recently a 5-dimensional space-time brane model was
proposed in order to adequately position consciousness and universal consciousness in the
cosmos (Carter, 2014a, 2014b), an item that was discussed earlier by Smythies, 2003
suggesting that consciousness may be in a brane rather than in the brain. Atmanspacher (2003)
explained that mind/matter correlations may require new science, in the sense that the use of
emergence and reductionistic schemes may not be adequate and should be replaced by
possible symmetry breaking within a domain in which matter and mind are unseparated. He
cites d’Espanat postulating an independent ”Ultimate Reality” that is neither mental nor
material.
Another issue is whether, more or less, random quantum events can be orchestrated in such
way that the information becomes meaningful for the brain. Thus the major challenge is to
directly demonstrate that proteins such as in microtubules, K+-channels or synaptic vesicles
and associated proteins become informative to the organism. It has been put forward that a
combination of quantum mechanisms and non-linear (chaos) theory have to be considered in
the amplification of subtle external information necessary for immediate action (King, 2003,
2011). Future information (feeling of future events) may be realized by time-reversed sensing
of such an event on the basis of an attractor state. According to the “supercausal” model of
consciousness of Chris King, the constant interaction between information coming from the
past and information coming from the future leads to that quantum entities that are always
confronted with bifurcations between past and future causes. This involves fractal structures
and chaotic dynamics that enable free choices to be performed. Consequently consciousness
30

should be a property of all living structures in which each biological process is forced to
choose between information coming from the past and information coming from the future
(King, 2003). Such models (including that of Vannini and Di Corpo, 2008) attribute
consciousness to principles of relativity, quantum physics, and fractal geometry and on the
basis of established physical applications of these theory’s, would, in principle, allow
experimental testing to falsify them. It is of interest that top-down recurrent connections in
higher order in the associative cortex was shown to be indispensable conscious perception
(Boly et al., 2011).
In more general terms: processing and amplification of quanta/wave information in the brain
may underlie the presumed higher brain or mental functions. If one assumes that such
detection mechanisms does indeed operate in the brain, than the next question is whether the
information to be processed is exclusively associated with quantum waves or quantum states
or, alternatively, with the specific proteins that carry them. Apart from discussing the inherent
mechanisms such as forward and backward causation, superposition and entanglement in the
mental space, we shortly treat the idea that that individual mind may, at least partly, be an
expression of universal consciousness as opposed to the concept the mind is merely an
attribute of matter.

David Bohm: Wholeness and the Implicate Order

David Bohm en Louis de Broglie
David Bohm, 1980, 1990, took the view that quantum theory and relativity contradicted one
another, and that this contradiction implied that there existed a more fundamental level in the
physical universe. He claimed that both quantum theory and relativity pointed towards this
deeper theory. This more fundamental level was supposed to represent an undivided
wholeness and an implicate order, from which arose the explicate order of the universe as we
actually experience it. The explicate order is seen as a particular case of the implicate order.
(Fig. 9).

31

Fig. 9: The Implicate Order concept af David Bohm in which particles and their more complex forms in
our classical world are steered by, so called, pilot waves that operate from a 4-dimensional hidden
domain, in a mode of active information.

The implicate order applies both to matter and consciousness, and it can therefore explain the
relationship between these two apparently different things. Mind and matter are here seen as
related projections into our explicate order from the underlying reality of the implicate order.
Bohm claims that when we look at the extension of matter and separation of its parts in space,
we can see nothing in these concepts that helps us with understanding consciousness.
Bohm compares this problem to Descartes discussion of the difference between mind and
matter. Descartes to some extent relied on God to resolve the gap. Bohm says that since
Descartes time the idea of introducing God into the equation has been let drop, but he argues
that as a result conventional modern thinking has no way left to it for bridging the gap
between matter and consciousness. In Bohm’s scheme there is an unbroken wholeness at the
fundamental level of the universe, in which consciousness is not separated from matter.
Bohm’s view of consciousness is closely connected to Karl Pribram’s, 1991 holographic
conception of the brain. Pribram sees sight and the other senses as lenses, without which the
universe would appear as a hologram. Pribram thinks that information is recorded all over the
brain, and that this information is enfolded into a whole, also in the manner of a hologram,
although it is suggested that the physical function involved is more complicated than a
32

hologram. In Pribram’s scheme, it is suggested that the different memories are connected by
association and manipulated by logical thought. If the brain is also attending to sensory data,
all of these facets are proposed to fuse together in an overall experience or unanalysable
whole. This is suggested to be closer to the essence of consciousness than the mere excitation
of neurons. In trying to arrive at a description of consciousness.
Bohm discusses the experience of listening to music. He thinks that the sense of movement
and change that constitutes the experience of the music relies on notes both from the
immediate past and the present being held in the brain at the same time. Bohm does not view
the notes from the immediate past as memories but as active transformations of what came
earlier. He proposes that a given moment can cover an extended duration, as opposed to the
more conventional ‘now’ concept of something instantaneous. The moment is proposed to
have extension in time and space, but the amount of this extension is not precisely defined.
One moment gives rise to the next, with content that was implicate in the immediate past
becoming explicate in the present. The sense of movement in music is the result of the
intermingling of transformations.
Bohm likens these transformations to the emergence of consciousness from the implicate
order. He thinks that in listening to music people are directly perceiving the implicate order.
The order is thought to be active and to flow into emotional and physical responses. Bohm
also discusses the problem of time, the concept of ‘now’ and the difficulty of distinguishing
‘now’ from the immediate past, which no longer exists. In classical physics this problem is
overcome via the calculus, with its concept of ‘the limit’, which is effectively a zero change in
time or space. This is successful for calculating the movement of material objects in classical
physics, which comprises the explicate order. However, it is not applicable to quantum theory
in which movement is not seen as continuous. In the implicate order intermingled elements
are present together, and processes are the outcome of what is enfolded in the implicate order.
In this structure, there is a flow between experience and logical thought that is considered by
Bohm to hold out the possibility of a bridge between matter and consciousness.
Bohm also advances the idea of overall necessity driving short-term brain processes. Thus it is
proposed that an ensemble of elements enfolded in the brain will constitute the next
development of thought, and that these elements are bound by an overall necessity that brings
them together, and also determines the next moment in consciousness. Bohm relates
movement to the implicate order; for movement, we can also read change or flow or the
coherence of our perception of a piece of music over a short period of time. Evidence for this is
claimed to derive from studies of infants (Piaget, 1956), who have to learn about space and
time, which are seen as part of the explicate order, but appear to have a hard-wired
understanding of movement that is implicate. Bohm’s view is that the movement and flow of
the implicate order are hard-wired into human brains, in the same way that Chomsky asserts
33

that grammar is hard- wired into the human brain, but that by way of contrast, the classical
space and time of the explicate order are something that has to be learnt by experience. Basil Hiley was the long-term associate of David Bohm, and is a continuing exponent of many
of his ideas (Bohm and Hiley, 1987, 1993). Hiley argues that the Bohmian notion of active
information introduced in relation to quantum phenomena can also be applied to classical
signalling. This is suggested to have relevance to concept of meaning as opposed to mere
information. Hiley queries whether the word ‘information’ that is widely used in science
including neuroscience always carries the same meaning. Bohm and Hiley were interested in
so-called active information that drives physical processes and leaves no choice as to whether
they are implemented or not. This is distinct from a mere list of data or instructions or a way
of viewing entropy. Active information has been used in a number of papers relative to the
mind/matter relationship (Hiley , 2001 and Hiley & Pylkkänen, 2005)
The colloquial understanding of information is that it is data from which meaning can be
extracted by an intelligent entity. Hiley regards it as a fundamental question as to whether
information has objective significance devoid of the subjective involvement. Verbal
communication is seen as a particular problem, where meaning is translated into sound waves
and then back into meaning. Hiley relates this meaning to the agency of the speaker and the
agency of the listener. He relates this inseparable link to Bohr’s notion of the indivisibility of
the quantum action, which cannot distinguish between the system under observation and the
means of observation.
Bohm believed that a quantum potential could be extracted from Schrödinger’s equation and
that this quantum potential could act as an information potential. In transmitting a signal there
is a trade off between the duration of the pulse and the frequency. There is an ambiguity in the
signal that is similar to the uncertainty in quantum mechanics. The two concepts are said to
employ different aspects of the same mathematical structure. Hiley refers to the two-slit
experiment, where the potential is claimed to cover the whole experimental arrangement. The
quantum information changes in relation to any change in the experimental arrangement, and
this is related to information entering the brain and changing the arrangement of its parts.
Within the brain Bohm thought that meaning was in the process itself. Bohm proposed that
there were two sides or two poles to the brain, the manifest and relatively stable material side
and the subtle mind-like side. The manifest side is classical physics, while the subtle side is the
quantum level that produces the classical level. Thus the mind cannot be separated from
matter. The ambiguity or uncertainty of the quantum comes through in the ambiguity
attached to meaning. The quantum is seen as a pool of information shared by entangled
particles. When the potential or pool vanishes, the classical world emerges. Hiley also agrees
that this system could operate in terms of quantum fields. The main weakness of this
34

description seems to be the lack of detail as to how the quantum mechanism would operate in
the brain, and the lack of distinction between information which does not by itself imply
consciousness and consciousness itself. The emergence of meaning could be thought to imply
consciousness but this important point is not at all developed.

Fig. 10: The reversible ink drop /cylinder-experiment, as an allegory for the unfolding of ”implicate order”
with hidden variables

In the 1960s Bohm began to take a closer look at the notion of order. One day he saw a device
on a television program that immediately fired his imagination. It consisted of two concentric
glass cylinders, the space between them being filled with glycerin, a highly viscous fluid. If a
droplet of ink is placed in the fluid and the outer cylinder is turned, the droplet is drawn out
into a thread that eventually becomes so thin that it disappears from view; the ink particles are
enfolded into the glycerin, (see Fig. 10) .
But if the cylinder is then turned in the opposite direction, the thread-form reappears and rebecomes a droplet; the droplet is unfolded again. Bohm realized that when the ink was
diffused through the glycerin it was not in a state of ’disorder’ but possessed a hidden, or nonmanifest, order. In Bohm’s view, all the separate objects, entities, structures, and events in the
visible or explicate world around us are relatively autonomous, stable, and temporary
’subtotalities’ derived from a deeper, implicate order of unbroken wholeness.
Bohm gives the analogy of a flowing stream: On this stream, one may see an ever-changing
pattern of vortices, ripples, waves, splashes, etc., which evidently have no independent
existence as such. Rather, they are abstracted from the flowing movement, arising and
vanishing in the total process of the flow. Such transitory subsistence as may be possessed by
35

these abstracted forms implies only a relative independence or autonomy of behavior, rather
than absolutely independent existence as ultimate substances.

Anthony Valentini

Valentini, 2002 consistently defends the pilot wave mechanism of David Bohm. Bohm, he
says, had an interesting trajectory. There are really three Bohms. There's the very early Bohm
who was interested in Niels Bohr's ideas about complementarity. Then there's the Bohm of the
1950s who worked on the pilot wave theory of hidden variables. Then in the 1960s he changed
again. He met Krishnamurti and got very interested in Indian philosophy and started trying to
tag some mystical ideas onto the pilot-wave theory. If you look at the yoga sutras of Patanjali
you can see this idea that material objects are somehow illusions and projections from
something deeper, that things emerge from this deeper level and disappear into this deeper
level again. So, indeed, Bohm tried to adopt an interpretation of the wave as a manifestation of
a deeper level, perhaps associated with consciousness.
Why does Valentini like the pilot-wave theory ?:
• It preserves a realist ontology wherein particles possess determinate values of
space-time location and momentum.
• They continue to possess such values between various acts of observation/measurement,
rather than acquiring them only in consequence of being measured with respect to this or that
parameter.
• This allows for greater continuity with certain components of classical (prequantum)
physics such as the conservation laws respecting matter-energy and angular momentum.
• The pilot-wave hypothesis produces results in perfect accordance with those
obtained in standard QM by means of the Schrödinger-derived wave probability
function.
• While avoiding any recourse to mysterious ideas of the wave packet collapse as
somehow brought about by observer intervention or only on the instant - in
Schrödinger’s parable - when the box is opened up for inspection and the cat thus release from
its supposed ‘superposed’ (dead-and-alive) state.
• Pilot-wave theory also seeks to explain quantum effects such as photon deflection or

36

multipath interference without proposing a massively expanded ontology of parallel worlds,
shadow universes, multiple intersecting realities, etc.
Pilot-wave theory has three axioms. The first is de Broglie’s law of motion, which specifies
exactly how particles are guided by the wave. The second is Schrödinger’s wave equation,
telling us how the wave itself changes over time. The third is that particles have to start off
with a certain probability distribution.“In any given experiment, each particle is accompanied
by a wave”. The particle starts off somewhere inside the wave. In order to give results that can
be verified with an experiment, all three axioms have to be used. In classical physics there is an
interplay between particle and field, each generates the dynamics of the other. In the original
pilot wave theory the steering wave acts on positions of particles, but it is not acted upon by
the particles. However Holland, (2001) has explored some deeper ideas related to this
question in his work on a possible Hamiltonian formulation of pilot-wave and proposed a
particle to wave back-reaction This implies that, through the pilot wave mechanism, particles,
just like waves, carry information regarding their future states. It also means that particle
trajectories may exert a back reaction on the wave function, implying symmetric interaction
between implicate and explicate orders.
What is so unusual about Antony Valentini? He, in fact, resurrected a theory that undoes the
central tenet of quantum mechanics, and gives relativity theory a support as well. The theory
follows quantum math, but at the same time allows for new possibilities beyond conventional
quantum mechanics. It's a theory that says there is indeed an objective reality behind the
things we observe, that quantum uncertainty is not fundamental, and that somewhere,
somehow, time is universal—not relative. This implies goodbye to ghostly probabilities, with
their strange propensity for collapsing into real things and hello to hidden variables that are
objective.
This seems related to the American physicist John Archibald Wheeler (1990, 2002), who
suspected that reality exists not because of physical particles, but rather because of the act of
observing the universe. "Information may not be just what we learn about the world. It may be
what makes the world." In other words: when humans ask questions about nature, there is an
active transfer of information in the domain of quantum waves where, in principle, backward
causation from the future is possible. The second arrow (from future to past) remains hidden
(unnoticed) for us, because life is trapped in the momentum of time. Entanglement means that
particles separated at any distance, under certain conditions, can have mutually determined
properties (are correlated). In this block universe multiple path’s or life lines are laid out of
which the individual chooses a single one. Consequently this concept allows free choice and
therefore is not deterministic. Such non-locality becomes manifest by observation (or collapse
of the wave aspect), as has been shown by electron spin orientation or polarized light. This
might also be viewed as backward causation.
37

According to Wheeler’s (1990) and Feynman’s electrodynamics, emitters coincide with
retarded fields, which propagate into the future, while absorbers coincide with advanced
fields, which propagate backward in time. This time-symmetric model leads to predictions
identical with those of conventional electrodynamics. For this reason it is impossible to
distinguish between time symmetric results and conventional results.
In his “Transactional Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, John Cramer (1988) stated that
"Nature, in a very subtle way, may be engaging in backwards-in-time handshaking: The
transaction between retarded waves, coming from the past, and advanced waves, coming
from the future, gives birth to a quantum entity with dual properties of the wave/particle.
Thus the wave property is a consequence of the interference between retarded and advanced
waves, and the particle property is a consequence of the point in space where the transaction
takes place”. The transactional interpretation requires that waves can really travel backwards
in time. This assertion seems counterintuitive, as we are accustomed to the fact that causes
precede effects. It is important to underline, however, that, unlike other interpretations of QM,
the transactional interpretation takes into account special relativity theory which describes
time as a dimension of space, as mentioned earlier. Of note, the completed transaction erases
all advanced effects, so that no direct advanced wave signaling is possible: “The future can
affect the past only very indirectly, by offering possibilities for transactions" (Cramer, 1988, see
Fig. 11).
King, 2003 (see later) stated: “the hand-shaking space-time relation implied by the
transactional interpretation makes it possible that the apparent randomness of quantum
events masks a vast interconnectivity at the sub-quantum level, reflecting Bohm’s implicate
order, although in a different manner from Bohm’s pilot wave theory. Because transactions
connect past and future in a time-symmetric way, they cannot be reduced to predictive
determinism, because the initial conditions are insufficient to describe the transaction, which
also includes quantum boundary conditions coming from the future absorbers. However this
future is also unformed in real terms at the early point in time emission takes place”.
The principle of backward causation has been experimentally demonstrated recently.
Aharonov’s team and various collaborating groups (see Aharonov, 2010), studied whether the
future may influence the past by sophisticated quantum physics technology. Aharonov
concluded that a particle’s past does not contain enough information to fully predict its fate,
but he wondered, if the information is not in its past, where could it be? Clearly, something
else must also regulate the particle’s behavior. Aharonov and coworkers proposed a new
framework called time-symmetric quantum mechanics. Recent series of quantum experiments in

38

Fig. 11: The transactional interpretation of QM of Cramer of retarded and advanced waves from past
and future that produce the present (up left) and the time-symmetric concept of the prize winning
Aharonov (upper right inset) arising from post-selection (soft) measurement of a quantum state, that
prevents wave collapse and also shows that the future may affect the past. This shows that through
the wave aspect the “wavicle”(inset right below), intrinsically contains an aspect of the future.

about 15 different laboratories around the world seem to actually confirm the notion that the
future can influence results that happened before those measurements were even made,
see Fig. 11.
Generally the protocol included three steps: a “pre-selection” measurement carried out on a
group of particles; an intermediate measurement; and a final, “post-selection” step in which
researchers picked out a subset of those particles on which to perform a third, related
measurement. To find evidence of backward causality, meaning information flowing from the
future to the past, the effects of, so called, weak measurements were studied. Weak
measurements involve the same equipment and techniques as traditional ones but do not
disturb the quantum properties in play. Usual (strong) measurements would immediately
collapse the wave functions in superposition to a definite state. The results in the various
groups were amazing: repeated post-selection measurement of the weak type changed the preselection state, revealing an aspect of non-locality. Thus it appears that the universe might
have a destiny that reaches back and “collaborates” with the past to bring the present into
view. On a cosmic scale, this idea could also help explain how life arose in the universe against
39

tremendous odds and confirms the idea that knowledge was inherited from a common
information pool (Meijer 2012, Kak, 2009, Jahn and Dunne, 2007).

Henry Stapp: attention, intention and quantum coherence

Henry Stapp
Stapp starts by asking what sort of brain action corresponds to a conscious thought. He
criticizes the mainstream for assuming that Newtonian physics can be applied directly to the
brain, and claims that a quantum framework is needed to understand the brain. The
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory was the first mainstream version, and was
pragmatic in recommending the theory as a system of rules that allowed the calculation of
empirically verifiable relationships between observations. Stapp, 2009, 2012, favors
Heisenberg’s refinement of the original Copenhagen position. Heisenberg thought that the
probability distribution of quantum theory really existed in nature, and that the evolution of
this probability was punctuated by uncontrolled events, which are the events that actually
occur in nature, and which at the same time eliminate the other probabilities.
The development of computing during the second half of the 20th century demonstrated that
thought-like or cognitive processes required internal representations not allowed for in the
then prevailing behaviourist concept. However, this still did not account for conscious
experience, and in this period thinking or cognition came to be seen as something separate
from consciousness.
Both Bohr and Heisenberg viewed quantum theory as a set of rules for making predictions
about observations under experimental conditions. These predictions are incompatible with
classical physics in respect of the prediction of non-locality. Heisenberg did not view the
quanta as actual things, but as tendencies for certain types of events to occur. The orderly
evolution of the system is deterministic, but this controls only the tendencies for things or
propensity for events, and not the actual things or events themselves. The things are
controlled by quantum jumps that do not individually conform to any natural law, but
collectively conform to statistical rules.

40

Heisenberg and Schödinger

Stapp, 2009, 2012, bases his proposal for quantum consciousness on three observations.
1.) The brain’s representation of the body or body schema must be represented by some
form of physical structure in the brain. 2.) Some brain processes such as the behavior of
calcium ions involved in synaptic transmission need to be treated quantum
mechanically. Stapp also thinks that the sensitivity and non-linearity of the synaptic
system, the involvement of calcium ions and the large number of meta-stable states into
which the brain could evolve all point to a quantum mechanical system. 3.) Stapp
suggests that the brain could evolve into a state analogous to the deterministic
evolution of the quantum state from which an actual state must be selected.
Although Stapp pays a lot of attention to the synapses his is not actually a neuron based
theory. Rather the event could be selected from the large scale excitation of the brain. The
selection of events from a wide range of probabilities is seen as being particular adaptive
where an organism needs to select from a range of future probabilities. Stapp wishes to
establish the relationship between mind and matter, the relationship between reality and
quantum theory, and also how relativity is reconciled with both experience and non-locality.
The solution is suggested to be a series of creative events bringing into being one of a range of
possibilities created by prior events. He suggests that consciousness exercises top-level control
over neural excitations in the brain. The neural excitations are regarded as a code, and each
human experience is regarded as a selection from this code. He sees the physical world as a
structure of tendencies in the world of the mind. He finds it as unacceptable that there is an
irreducible element of chance in nature as described by quantum theory, which is the most
usual conclusion to be drawn from the randomness of the wave function collapse. The element
of conscious choice is seen as removing chance from nature. He distinguishes between systems
where an external representation and knowledge of the laws of physics can accurately predict
how the system develops, and his own idea of a system that is internally determined in a way
that cannot be represented outside the system.
41

The brain is viewed as a self-programming computer with self-sustaining neural patterns as
the codes. It is necessary to integrate the code from sensory input, with the code from previous
experience. This creates a number of probabilities, from which consciousness has to select. The
conscious act is the selection of a piece of top-level code, which then exercises control over the
flow of neural excitation. The unity of conscious thought comes from a unifying force in the
conscious act itself. It selects a single code from amongst a multitude on offer in the brain.
Raising an arm involves a conscious act selecting the top-level code that raises the arm. This is
suggested to close the traditional explanatory gap between thought and classical physics,
because here the conscious thought is the selection of the code that allows the physical act.
Stapp goes on to discuss the conscious process of looking at pictures. According to him toplevel codes instruct lower-level codes to produce new top level codes and to initiate their
storage in memory. The experience of noticing something is deemed to be the process of
initiation into memory. There are close connections between the top-level code and the
memory structure. The lower level codes have to be functioning correctly i.e. not damaged,
and to be focused on the incoming stimuli in order for it to be put into higher level code and to
be registered in memory.
Stapp discusses what neural research would need to reveal if it were to support his theory. It
would need to reveal the neural connections needed to support self-sustaining patterns of
neural excitation. It is necessary to find the neurons providing the top level coding, then the
mechanism for storing memory traces of this, and finally the mechanism by which these
memories are involved in the production of new top-level codes. Each conscious experience is
seen as a creative act represented in the physical world by the selection of a top level code
from among the many generated by the laws of quantum theory. The conscious experiences
are the initiation of processes that produce changes in the body schema and the external and
internal reality schema. The conscious act is functionally equivalent to changes in the physical
world as represented in quantum theory. In the Heisenberg version of quantum theory
physical things are events and quantum theory gives the propensity for particular events to
occur. This is seen as providing a link between conscious processes and brain processes. In the
Heisenberg version it is the act of observation which leads to the selection of a particular
propensity.
Stapp attaches great importance to the idea of the formation of a record. This is seen as
analogous to the Geiger counter that registers a record of a quantum event. Every conscious
experience is seen as recordable, because it is evidence of some form of brain process. The later
retrievability of the experience is evidence of a record in the brain. A key process in brain
dynamics is seen as persisting patterns of neural excitation producing physical changes in

42

neurons that enable a particular pattern to be re-excited, and allow re-excited pattern to
connect with new stimuli. This is seen as the basis of the brain’s associative memory.
The top-level brain process is viewed as a process of actualizing symbols, composed of earlier
symbols connected into a whole by neural links. The top-level process is seen as directing
information gathering, planning and choice of particular plans, monitoring the execution of
plans. This can be understood in terms of top-level direction of multiple neural processes.
Because of the top-level directive role, its connection to associative memory and the multiple
structure of the symbols involved it is suggested that each top-level event corresponds to a
psychological event, and this in turn connects psychological events to the quantum level. Both
the top-level brain event and the psychological event act as choosers of a possibility, or
converters of potentialities into actualities. Each human conscious experience is seen as the feel
of an event in the top-level of processing in the human brain, a sequence of Heisenberg actual
events, actualizing a quasi-stable pattern of neural activity. Activation of particular symbols
creates a tendency for the activation of other related symbols. The body schema is the product
of actualized events accumulated over the life of the body. The top-level symbols have
compositional structure formed from other symbols. The Heisenberg events are seen as being
capable of grasping a whole a pattern of activity, and this is seen as accounting for the unity of
consciousness. The continuity or flow of time is explained by an overlap of symbols with the
preceding mental event.
Stapp drawing on studies of infants assumes that humans have a hard-wired body-world
schema. Consciously directed action is seen as a projection of this body-world schema into the
future, with a corresponding representation in the brain. This body-world schema is seen as
directing the unconscious brain, issuing commands for motor action and instructions for
mental processing. Ongoing questions to nature continue to be posed by the observer. This
equates to the ‘Heisenberg choice’, where the human observer has to decide what question to
put to nature. In this case it is the conscious processing in the brain that does this. Each
experience leads to further updating of the system.
When an action is initiated by a thought, this usually includes some monitoring of the
subsequent action, to check it against the intended action. So something experienced as an
intention becomes an action, the attention to which is also experienced. Stapp views the
deterministic unfolding of matter according to the Schrödinger equation as running parallel to
the movement from intention to attention, as two poles of the same quantum event that
prolong the coherent state and thereby protect against potential decoherence. He also sees a
tripartite structure being the Schrödinger equation, the Heisenberg choice of question to ask
and the (Dirac) choice of answer from nature.

43

Stapp’s point is that only a conscious observer within the brain can ask the question, and drive
the quantum process. This also allows the experiential process to enter into the causal
structure of the body/brain. Stapp feels that some additional process is needed and the
conscious observer is a perfect candidate. He sees quantum theory as informational in nature
and thus linked to increments in knowledge occurring in the brain. The increment in
knowledge is seen as linked to a reduction in the quantum state, thus linking mind to the
physical world. Mind is thus seen as entering into the physical world through the Heisenberg
choice.
When the quantum state is reduced a wave that extends over an indefinite amount of space is
instantaneously reduced to a tiny local region. Stapp feels that this constitutes a representation
of knowledge rather than a representation of matter. The wave before collapse is seen as a
matter of potentiality or probabilities, which are themselves often conceived as ideas rather
than realities. However, the quantum state pre-collapse evolves in line with the deterministic
Schrödinger equation, giving the state some of the properties of the physical, thus and creating
in fact a sort of hybrid.
Stapp does not suggest that our conscious thoughts are completely unconstrained, but he does
see our thoughts as a part of the causal structure of the mind-brain that is not dominated by
the actions of the smallest components of the brain, but is also not a random effect. Our
thoughts are seen not as linked to external objects, but instead linked to patterns of brain
activity. Stapp points out that his theory has a place for an efficacious conscious mind linked
to the physical processes of the brain. He suggests that the dynamic of the Schrödinger
evolution, which is to produce an event that replicates the event that produced, it could
somehow stand in for the later action of conscious minds. The identity theory of mind claims
that each mental state is identical to some process in the brain. However, classical physics says
that the entire causal structure of a physical system is determined by the microscopic level of
the physical structure, so that larger scale effects such as consciousness cannot have any
influence.
A potential problem with the whole Copenhagen influenced interpretation of quantum theory
is its possible dualism. Mathematics can be seen as a mental process instantiated in protein,
which, in principle, cannot directly influence the external world. Somehow the mathematical
description of the quantum waves is sitting out there in space, and then as a result of a
measurement becomes a physical particle. In Copenhagen, a mental concept external to the
body seems to become physical with no explanation as to how the two could interact. The
Copenhagen system has the additional problem of what was happening before human minds
emerged to perform measurements, for which Stapp’s explanation appears rather sketchy.
Consequently, a more detailed model is required to picture the inherent interaction between a
more general form of consciousness as a measuring device in evolution (see later).
44

Roger Penrose: Consciousness and the Spacetime Geometry of Universe

Roger Penrose, 1989, 1994, 2004, is one of the very few thinkers to consider how
consciousness could arise from first principles rather than merely trying to shoe horn it into
nineteenth century physics, and his ideas appear to be a good starting point from which to try
to understand consciousness as a fundamental.
Penrose’s approach was a counter attack on the functionalism of the late 20 th century, which
claimed that computers and robots could be conscious. He approached the question of
consciousness from the direction of mathematics. The centre piece of his argument is a
discussion of Gödel’s theorem. Gödel demonstrated that any formal system or any significant
system of axioms, such as elementary arithmetic, cannot be both consistent and complete.
There will be statements that are undecidable, because although they are seen to be true, but
are not provable in terms of the axioms.
Penrose’s controversial claim: The Gödel theorem as such is not controversial in relation to
modern logic and mathematics, but the argument that Penrose derived from it has proved to
be highly controversial. Penrose claimed that the fact that human mathematicians can see the
truth of a statement that is not demonstrated by the axioms means that the human mind
contains some function that is not based on algorithms, and therefore could not be replicated
by a computer. This is because the functioning of computers is based solely on algorithms (a
system of calculations). Penrose therefore claimed that Gödel had demonstrated that human
brains could do something that no computer was able to do.
Arguments against Penrose’s position: Some critics of Penrose have suggested that while
mathematicians could go beyond the axioms, they were in fact using a knowable algorithm
present in their brains. Penrose contests this, arguing that all possible algorithms are defeated
by the Gödel problem. In respect to arguments as to whether computers could be programmed
to deal with Gödel propositions, Penrose accepts that a computer could be instructed as to the
non-stopping property of Turing’s halting problem. Here, a proposition that goes beyond the
original axioms of the system is put into a computation. However, this proposition is not part
of the original formal system, but instead relies on the computer being fed with human
insights, so as to break out of the difficulty. So the apparently non-algorithmic insights are
required to supplement the functioning of the computer in this instance.
45

An unknowable algorithm: Penrose further discusses the suggestion of an unknowable
algorithm that enables mathematicians to perceive the truth of statements. He argues that
there is no escape from the knowability of algorithms. An unknowable algorithm means an
algorithm, whose specification could not be achieved. But any algorithm is in principle
knowable, because it depends on the natural numbers, which are knowable. Further, it is
possible to specify natural numbers that are larger than any number needed to specify the
algorithmic action of an organism, such as a human or a human brain.
Mathematical robots: Penrose says that with a mathematical robot, it would not be practical to
encode all the possible insights of mathematicians. The robot would have to learn certain
truths by studying the environment, which in its turn is assumed to be based on algorithms.
But to be a creative mathematician, the robot will need a concept of unassailable truth, that is a
concept that some things are obviously true.
This involves the mathematical robot having to perceive that a formal system ‘H’ implies the
truth of its Gödel proposition, and at the same time perceiving that the Gödel proposition
cannot be proved by the formal system ‘H’. It would perceive that the truth of the proposition
follows from the soundness of the formal system, but the fact that the proposition cannot be
proved by the axioms also derives from the formal system. This would involve a contradiction
for the robot, since it would have to believe something outside the formal system that
encapsulated its beliefs.
Amongst experts in this area who do not entirely reject Penrose’s argument, Feferman, 1996
has criticized Penrose’s detailed argument, but is much closer to his position than to that of
mainstream consciousness studies. Feferman makes common cause with Penrose in opposing
the computational model of the mind, and considering that human thought, and in particular
mathematical thought, is not achieved by the mechanical application of algorithms, but rather
by trial-and-error, insight and inspiration, in a process that machines will never share with
humans. Feferman finds numerous flaws in Penrose’s work, but at the end he informs his
readers that Penrose’s case would not be altered by putting right the logical flaws that
Feferman has spent much time discovering.
Feferman’s own position is that the computational-mind argument is misleading in terms of
the weight that it places on the equivalence between Turing machines and formal systems. The
model of mathematical thought in terms of formal systems is considered to be closer to the
nature of human thought, and particularly mathematical thought, than to the functioning of
Turing machines. The Turing machine model would assume that given a problem, human
reason would plug away, applying the same algorithm indefinitely, in the hope of finding an
46

answer. Feferman says that it is ridiculous to think that mathematics is performed in this way.
Trial-and-error reasoning, insight and inspiration, based on prior experience, but not on
general rules, are seen as the basis of mathematical success. A more mechanical approach is
only appropriate, after an initial proof has been arrived at. Then this approach can be used for
mechanical checking of something initially arrived at by trial-and-error and insight. He views
mathematical thought as being non-mechanical. He says that he agrees with Penrose that
understanding is essential to mathematical thought, and that it is just this area of mathematical
thought that machines cannot share with us.

Fig. 12: The Twistor theory as proposed by Penrose to find a basic structure for spacetime geometry, as
is also attempted by String theories. Twistor theory was later on applied by Witten in the universal
string M-theory, to diminish the total number of required extra dimensions

Penrose’s own take on the wave function collapse suggests that it is a real event. He sees
superposition as a separation in the underlying space-time geometry. Each quanta is
embedded in a bit of space, and as the superpositions grow further apart, a blister or
separation appears in space-time. This can be viewed as the same thing as the beginning of the
multiple world view, but instead of going on to generate separate universes, if the separation
between superpositions grows to more than the Planck length, the wave collapses and chooses
one of the superposed alternatives.
Twistor theory (Fig. 12) in the context of space-time has been pioneered by Roger Penrose and
others since the 1960s and is based on the association of a complex twistor space CP3 to the
space of light rays in space-time. The name derives from the Robinson congruence which is the
47

natural realization of a (non-null) twistor. Penrose thereby attempted to encode spacetime
points, affording a quantized spacetime. Some appealing aspects of the theory are:
-twistor space becomes the basic space so that light rays are the fundamental
objects from which space-time is derived;
- discrete quantities such as spin are represented in the discrete values obtained by contour
integration;
- its evident elegance and simplicity
The normal quantum wave collapse is seen as an entirely random choice of the state of a
quantum particle, from amongst the various superpositions of states. However, these collapses
involve interaction with the environment. Penrose suggests that a quanta, which does not
interact with the environment will undergo objective reduction (OR) when the separation
between superpositions begins to exceed the Planck length. He also suggests that while the
normal collapse is totally random OR is not totally random but involves a non-computable
process. This is suggested because Penrose thinks that the brain manifests a noncomputational aspect, and that the wave function collapse is the only place in the universe
where such a thing can exist. Penrose also proposes that OR based quantum computation
occurs in the brain.
Penrose’s search for a non-algorithmic feature: Penrose went on to ask, what it was in the
human brain that was not based on algorithms. The physical law is described by mathematics,
so it is not easy to come up with a process that is not governed by algorithms. The only
plausible candidate that Penrose could find was the collapse of the quantum wave function,
where the choice of the position of a particle is random, and therefore not the product of an
algorithm. However, he considered that the very randomness of the wave collapse disqualifies
it as a useful basis for the mathematical judgement or understanding in which he was initially
interested.
The wave function: In respect of consciousness, it is Penrose’s attitude to the reality of the
quantum wave function collapse that is the important area. In particular, he disagrees with the
traditional Copenhagen interpretation, which says that the theory is just an abstract
calculational procedure, and that the quanta only achieve objective reality when a
measurement has been made. Thus in the Copenhagen approach reality somehow arises from
the unreal or from abstraction, giving a dualist quality to the theory.
The discussion of quantum theory repeatedly comes back to the theme that Penrose regards
the quantum world and the uncollapsed wave function as having objective existence. In
Penrose’s view, the objective reality of the quantum world allows it to play a role in
consciousness. Penrose emphasizes that the evolution of the wave function portrayed by the
48

Schrödinger equation is both deterministic and linear. This aspect of quantum theory is not
random. Randomness only emerges when the wave function collapses, and gives the choice of
a particular position or other properties for a particle. Penrose discusses the various takes
made on wave function collapse by physicists. Some would like everything to depend on the
Schrödinger equation, but Penrose rejects this idea, because it is impossible to see how the
mechanism of this equation could produce the transformation from the superposition of
alternatives, as found in the quantum wave, to the random choice of a single alternative.
He also discusses the suggestion that the probabilities of the quantum wave that emerges into
macroscopic existence arise from uncertainties in the initial conditions and that the system is
analogous to chaos in macroscopic physics. This does not satisfy Penrose, who points out that
chaos is based on non-linear developments, whereas the Schrödinger equation is linear.
Important distinction between Penrose and Wigner
Penrose also disagrees with Eugene Wigner’s (see Wigner, 1992) suggestion that it is
consciousness that collapses the wave function, on the basis that consciousness is only
manifest in special corners of spacetime. Penrose himself advances the exact opposite proposal
that the collapse of a special (objective) type of wave function produces consciousness. It is
important to stress this difference between the Penrose and the Wigner position, as some
commentators mix up Wigner’s idea with Penrose’s propositions on quantum consciousness,
and then advance a refutation of Wigner, wrongly believing it to be a refutation of Penrose.
Penrose is also dismissive of the ‘many worlds’ version of quantum theory, which would have
an endless splitting into different universes with, for instance, Schrödinger’s cat alive in one
universe and dead in another universe. Penrose objects to the lack of economy and the
multitude of problems that might arise from attempting such a solution, and in addition
argues that the theory does not explain why the splitting has to take place, and why it is not
possible to be conscious of superpositions.
Objective reduction, Consciousness, Spacetime and the Second law & Gravity
Penrose instead argues for some new physics, and in particular an additional form of wave
function collapse. If the superpositions described by the quantum wave extended into the

shown to have 9 rings representing 32 actual phenyl or indole rings per tubulin, with coupled,
oscillating London force dipole orientations among rings traversing ‘quantum channels’ , aligning
with rings in adjacent tubulins in helical pathways through microtubule lattices. On the right,

macroscopic world, we would in fact see superpositions of large-scale objects. As this does not
happen, it is argued that something that is part of objective reality must take place to produce
the reality that we actually see. This requirement for new physics is often criticized as
unjustified. However, these criticisms tend to ignore the fact that while quantum theory
provides many accurate predictions, there has never been satisfactory agreement about its
interpretation, nor has its conflict with relativity been resolved.
Penrose sees consciousness as not only related to the quantum level but also to spacetime. He
discusses the spacetime curvature described in general relativity. He looks at the effect of
singularities relative to two spacetime curvature tensors, Weyl and Ricci. Weyl represents the
tidal effect of gravity, by which the part of a body nearest to the gravitational source falls
fastest creating a tidal distortion in the body. Ricci represents the inward pull on a sphere
surrounding the gravitational force. In a black hole singularity, the tidal distortion of Weyl
would predominate over Ricci, and Weyl goes to infinity at the singularity.
However, in the early universe expanding from the Big Bang, the inward tidal distortion is
absent, so Weyl=0, while it is the inward pressure of Ricci that predominates. So the early
universe is seen to have had low entropy with Weyl close to zero. Weyl is related to
50

gravitational distortions, and Weyl close to zero indicates a lack of gravitational clumping, just
as Weyl at infinity indicated the gravitational collapse into a black hole. Weyl close to zero and
low gravitational clumping therefore indicate low entropy at the beginning of the universe.
The fact the Weyl is constrained to zero is seen by Penrose as a function of quantum gravity.
The whole theory is referred to as the Weyl curvature hypothesis. The question that Penrose
now asks is as to why initial spacetime singularities have this structure. He thinks that
quantum theory has to help with the problem of the infinity of singularities. This would be a
quantum theory of the structure of spacetime, or in other words a theory of quantum gravity.
Penrose regards the problems of quantum theory in respect of the disjuncture between the
Schrödinger equations deterministic evolution and the randomness in wave function collapse
as fundamental. He thinks in terms of a time-asymmetrical quantum gravity, because the
universe is time-asymmetric from low to high entropy. He argues that the conventional
process of collapse of the wave function is time-asymmetric. He describes an experiment
where light is emitted from a source and strikes a half-silvered mirror with a resulting 50%
probability that the light reaches a detector and 50% that it hits a darkened wall. This
experiment cannot be time reversed, because if the original emitter now detects an incoming
photon, there is not a 50% probability that it was emitted by the wall, but instead 100%
probability that it was emitted by the other detecting/emitting device.
Penrose relates the loss of information that occurs in black holes to the quantum mechanical
effects of the black hole radiation described by Stephen Hawking. This relates the Weyl
curvature that is seen to apply in black holes and the quantum wave collapse. As Weyl
curvature is related to the second law of thermodynamics, this is taken to show that the
quantum wave reduction is related to the second law and to gravity. He proposes that in
certain circumstances there could be an alternative form of wave function collapse. He called
this objective reduction (OR). He suggests that as a result of the evolution of the Schrodinger
wave, the superpositions of the quanta grow further apart. According to Penrose’s
interpretation of general relativity, each superposition of the quanta is conceived to have its
own spacetime geometry. The separation of the superpositions, each with its own spacetime
geometry constitutes a form of blister in space-time. However once the blister or separation
grows to more than the Planck length of 10-35 meters, the separations begin to be affected by
the gravitational force, the superposition becomes unstable, and it soon collapses under the
pressure of its gravitational self-energy. As it does so, it chooses one of the possible spacetime
geometries for the particle. This form of wave function collapse is proposed to exist in addition
to the more conventional forms of collapse (see also Fig.13).

51

Evidence for non-computational spacetime
In support of this, he points out that when the physicists, Geroch and Hartle, 1986 studied
quantum gravity, they ran up against a problem in deciding whether two spacetimes were the
same. The problem was solvable in two dimensions, but intractable in the four dimensions
that accord with the four dimensional spacetime, in which the superposition of quantum
particles needs to be modeled. It has been shown that there is no algorithm for solving this
problem in four dimensions.
Earlier the mathematician, A. Markov, had shown there was no algorithm for such a problem,
and that if such an algorithm did exist, it could solve the Turing halting, for which it had
already been shown that there was no algorithm. The possibly non-computable nature of the
structure of four-dimensional space-time is deemed to open up the possibility that wave
function collapses could give access to this non-computable feature of fundamental spacetime.
A long-term experiment is underway to test Penrose’s hypothesis of objective reduction. This
experiment is currently being run by Bouwmeester at the University of California, Santa
Barbara and involves mirrors only ten micrometres across and weighing only a few trillionths
of a kilo, and the measurement of their deflection by a photon. The experiment is expected to
take ten years to complete. This means that theories of consciousness based on objective
reduction are likely to remain speculative for at least that length of time. However, the ability
to run an experiment that could look to falsify objective reduction, at least qualifies it as a
scientific theory.
Significance for consciousness
The significance of this for the study of consciousness is that, in contrast to the conventional
idea of wave function collapse, this form of collapse is suggested to be non-random, and
instead driven by a non-computable function at the most fundamental level of spacetime.
Penrose argues that, in contrast to the conventional wave function form of collapse, there are
indications that in this case, there is a decision process that is neither random nor
computationally/algorithmically based, but is more akin to the ‘understanding’ by which
Penrose claims the human brain goes beyond what can be achieved by a computer.
The road from physics to mental phenomena has already been frequented, notoriously by
Pauli and Jung and, under the influence of Pauli, by Heisenberg. The interaction is not limited
to a three decades-long Jung–Pauli epistolary and the reciprocal influences have been
profound. The founding role of Pauliʼs work in quantum physics does not need to be recalled
( Pauli, 1994) and the effects of his quantum vision in the development of Jungʼs vision of the
52

human mind (archetypes included) have been well explored. The title of the essay by Jung in
their co-authored volume “Synchronizität als ein Prinzip akausaler Zusammenhänge”
(Synchronicity as a Principle of Acausal Connections) could not indicate more clearly the
influence of Pauliʼs quantism on Jungʼs perception of reality (Jung and Pauli, 1955), and the
interplay of the two great minds. Before them, the self-referentiality of the Euclidean approach
to human consciousness has been narrated by Lewis Carroll in his “Through the lookingglass”.
Philosophically, Orch OR perhaps aligns most closely with Alfred North Whitehead, (see link
Wikipedia) and who viewed mental activity as a process of ‘occasions’, spatio-temporal
quanta, each endowed—usually on a very low level, with mentalistic characteristics which
were ‘dull, monotonous, and repetitious’. These seem analogous, in the Orch OR context, to
‘proto-conscious’ non-orchestrated OR events. Whitehead viewed high level mentality,
consciousness, as being extrapolated from temporal chains of such occasions. In his view
highly organized societies of occasions permit primitive mentality to become intense, coherent
and fully conscious. These seem analogous to Orch OR conscious events. Abner Shimony,
2005, Henry Stapp, 2007 and Hameroff, 1998 recognized that Whiteheadʼs approach was
potentially compatible with modern physics, specifically quantum theory, with quantum state
reductions—actual events—appearing to represent ‘occasions’, namely Whiteheadʼs high level
mentality, composed of ‘temporal chains … of intense, coherent and fully conscious occasions’
(Fig. 14), these being tantamount to sequences of Orch OR events.
These might possibly coincide with gamma synchrony, but with our current ‘beat frequency’
ideas gamma synchrony might more likely to be a beat effect than directly related to the OR
reduction time τ. As Orch OR events are indeed quantum state reductions, Orch OR and
Whiteheadʼs process philosophy appear to be quite closely compatible. Whiteheadʼs low-level
‘dull’ occasions of experience would seem to correspond to our non orchestrated ‘protoconscious’ OR events. According to this scheme, OR processes would be taking place all the
time everywhere and, normally involving the random environment, would be providing the
effective randomness that is characteristic of quantum measurement. Quantum superpositions
will continually be reaching a threshold for OR in non-biological settings as well as in
biological ones, and OR would usually take place in the purely random environment such as
in a quantum system under measurement. Nonetheless, in the Orch OR scheme, these events
are taken to have a rudimentary subjective experience, which is undifferentiated and lacking
in cognition, perhaps providing the constitutive ingredients of what philosophers call qualia.
We term such un-orchestrated, ubiquitous OR events, lacking information and cognition,
‘proto-conscious’. See Fig 14.

that have a mental and physical pole and carry elements of goals, satisfaction and beauty. They

In this regard, Orch OR has some points in common with the viewpoint, which incorporates
spiritualist, idealist and panpsychist elements, these being argued to be essential precursors of
consciousness that are intrinsic to the universe. It should be stressed, however, that Orch OR is
strongly supportive of the scientific attitude, and it incorporates the viewpointʼs picture of
neural electrochemical activity, accepting that non-quantum neural network membrane-level
functions might provide an adequate explanation of much of the brainʼs unconscious activity.
Orch OR in microtubules inside neuronal dendrites and soma adds a deeper level for
conscious processes.

Stuart Hameroff: Quantum coherence in brain tubules

Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose
Hameroff and Penrose, 2011 2013, classify all the mainstream approaches to consciousness as
‘classical functionalism’. Functionalism takes no account of what the brain is made of or of
anything finer grained than the level of neuron-to-neuron connections. It believes that these
connections could be copied in another material such as silicon, and that the resulting
construct would be conscious. However, Hameroff argues that although axonal spikes and
synaptic connections clearly play a key role in information processing in the brain, they may
not be the main currency of consciousness. Hameroff argues that quantum processing in
microtubules within the dendrites and gap junctions between dendrites are the main currency
of consciousness.
The main case against quantum processing in the brain has always been that any quantum
coherence in the brain would decohere faster than the time taken for any useful biological
process. Hameroff accepts that this is in principle a valid argument. However, Hameroff
claims that the microtubules may be screened from their environment by a gelatinous nonliquid ordered state that arises in the neuronal interior.
A further objection to quantum processing is that even if it arose in one neuron, it would
difficult for it to communicate across the brain. This is countered by the suggestion that there
could be quantum tunneling at gap junctions between neurons. In recent years, gap junctions
have been discovered to be more widespread in the brain than was previously thought. They
are also correlated with the 40Hz gamma synchrony. This oscillation was at one time
promoted by Crick and Koch as the most promising correlate of consciousness. However, the
idea fell from favour with mainstream neuroscience, when it was discovered that the gamma
synchrony correlated with dendritic activity rather than axonal spiking.
In general, Hameroff argues that the emerging evidence of neurobiology has moved in favour
of the Orch OR model over the last decade, not withstanding the continued unpopularity of
the theory. Hameroff summarizes his proposals in the early part of the chapter. He thinks that
consciousness arises in the dendrites of neurons that are connected by gap junctions to form
55

‘hyperneurons’, and that these are related to the gamma synchrony. Axonal spikes and
synapses are seen as making inputs to and receiving outputs from the microtubular process as
part of an interactive systems.
Hameroff touches on the famous Libet, 2006 experiments that demonstrated a 500ms timelag
between a stimulus and the perception of it entering consciousness, although the subject is not
aware of this time lag, as a result of a so-called backward referral in time. The mainstream has
tended to favour an interpretation resembling the Dennett ‘multiple drafts’ concept, which
would involve an after the event reconstruction of what had happened. Hameroff, however,
thinks that the backward referral in time should be taken seriously. This was also the view of
Roger Penrose, who suggested that backward referral (Fig. 15) might be indicative of quantum
activity.

Fig.15 : Backward referral of time as proposed by Libet et al.
Hameroff points out that changes in dendrites can lead to increased synaptic activity. This is
basic to ideas about learning, memory and neural correlates of consciousness. The changes in
dendrites involve the number and arrangement of receptors and the arrangement of dendritic
spines and dendrite-to-dendrite connections. Axon potentials or spikes have been assumed to
be the main basis of consciousness, but Hammerof suggests that there could be other
candidates. Electrodes implanted into the brain detect mainly the activity of dendritic gap
junctions plus inhibitory chemical synapses. Thus the detected synchrony derives from
dendrites rather than axonal spikes.
56

The main function of dendrites is seen to be the handling of input signal into the neuron,
which may eventually result in an axon spike. However, this is not the whole story, since
many cortical neurons have dendrites but no axons. Here dendrites interact with other
dendrites. Also there can be extensive dendritic activity with no spikes. The evidence suggests
that there are complex logic functions in the dendrites, and these may oscillate over a wide
area, while remaining below the axon spiking threshold. Many post-synaptic receptors send
signals into the dendrite cytoskeleton
Gamma synchronies, in the 30-70 Hz range, have aroused interest as possible correlates of
consciousness. Gray and Singer, 1989, found coherent gamma oscillations in the brain that
were dependent on visual stimulation. It was suggested that this synchrony could solve the
binding problem, which is the problem of how the different inputs into the brain are bound
together into a single conscious experience. It was suggested that the synchrony relected the
activity of a relevant assembly of neurons. Varela, 1995 noted that synchrony operated
whenever the processing of spatially separated parts of the brain were brought together in
consciousness. Gamma synchrony has been demonstrated across cortical areas, hemispheres
and the sensory/motor modalities. The synchrony is involved in a range of brain activities
including perception of sound, REM dream sleep, attention, working memory, face
recognition and somatic perception. Also gamma decreases during general anesthesia and
returns on waking from this. Hameroff regards gamma synchrony as the best overall correlate
of consciousness.
He further addresses the question of how the gamma synchrony is mediated. There is
coherence over large areas of the brain, sometimes including multiple cortical areas and both
hemispheres of the brain, with zero or near zero phase lag. If the synchrony was based on the
axon/synapse system a considerable lag would be expected. In fact, the lack of coherence
between the synchrony and axonal spike activity has led to a reduction in the amount of
mainstream attention paid to the gamma synchrony.
Hameroff points to gap junctions as an alternative to synapses for connections between
neurons. Neurons that are connected by gap junctions depolarize synchronously. Gap
junctions play a more important role in the adult brain than was previously supposed.
Numerous studies show that gap junctions mediate the gamma synchrony. A neuron may
have many gap junction connections but not all of them are necessarily open at the same time.
The opening and closing of the junctions may be regulated by the microtubules.
Hameroff suggests that cells connected by gap junctions may in fact constitute a cell assembly,
with the added advantage of synchronous excitation. Cortical inhibitory neurons are heavily
studded with gap junctions, possibly connecting each cell to 20 to 50 others (4). The axons of

57

these neurons tend to form inhibitory GABA chemical synapses on the dendrites of other
interneurons.

Fig. 16: Schematic representation of a brain microtubule, build up from tubulin proteins that
can undergo rapid fluctuations in three dimensional configuration, enabling the sensing and
transmission of quantum information (Qbits), see also Fig. 13.
Hameroff moves on to discuss the role of the cytoskeleton, which is seen to determine the
structure, growth and function of neurons. Actin is the main constituent of dendritic spines
and is present throughout the neuronal interior. Actin can de-polymerize into a dense
meswork, and when this happens the interior of the cell is converted from an aqueous solution
into a gelatinous state. Furthermore, when this happens the whole of the cytoskeleton forms a
negatively charged matrix around which water molecules are bound into an ordered state. It is
noted that the neurotransmitter glutamate binding to NMDA and AMPA receptors cause gel
states in actin spines.
The cytoskeleton of the dendrites is distinct both from that found in cells outside the brain and
from the cytoskeleton found in the axons of neurons. The microtubules in dendrites are
shorter than those in axons and have mixed as opposed uniform polarity. This appears a suboptimal arrangement from a normal structural point of view, and it is suggested that in
conjunction with microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), this arrangement may be optimal
for information processing rather than supportive structural functions. These
microtubule/MAP arrangements are connected to synaptic receptors on the dendrite
58

membrane by a variety of calcium and sodium influxes, actin and other inputs. Alterations in
the microtubule/MAPs network in the dendrites correlate with the arrangement of dendrite
synapatic receptors. Studies demonstrate that the cytoskeleton is also involved in signal
transmission. It is suggested that the microtubule lattice is well designed to represent and
process information (Fig. 17).
Tubulin was supposed to switch between two conformations (see Fig. 18). It is suggested that
tubulin conformational states could interact with with neighboring tubulin by means of dipole
interactions. The dipole-coupled conformation for each tubulin could be determined by the six
surrounding tubulins. Hameroff describes protein conformation as a delicate balance between
countervailing forces. Proteins are chains of amino-acids that fold into three dimensional
conformations. Folding is driven by van der Waals forces between hydrophobic amino-acid
groups. These groups can form hydrophobic pockets in some proteins. These pockets are
critcal to the folding and regulation of protein. Amino acid side groups in these pockets
interact by van der Waals forces. Non-polar atoms and molecules can have instantaneous
dipoles.

Fig.17 : An ‘integrate-and-fire’ brain neuron, and portions of other such neurons are shown
schematically with internal microtubules. In dendrites and cell body/soma (left) involved in
integration, microtubules are interrupted and of mixed polarity, interconnected by microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs) in recursive networks (upper circle, right). Dendritic–somatic integration
(with contribution from microtubule processes) can trigger axonal firings to the next synapse.
Microtubules in axons are unipolar and continuous. Gap junctions synchronize dendritic membranes,
and may enable entanglement and collective integration among microtubules in adjacent neurons
(lower circle right). In Orch OR, microtubule quantum computations occur during dendritic/somatic
integration, and the selected results regulate axonal firings which control behavior
59

Hameroff discusses the process of anesthesia which erases consciousness, but leaves many
non-conscious functions intact. Anesthetic gas molecules are soluble in a lipid-like
hydrophobic environment. Such areas are present in the brain in the lipid regions of cell
membranes and in hydrophobic pockets within proteins. It is suggested that anesthetic gas
molecules interact with amino-acid groups via London forces, altering the normal action of
London forces on the conformation of protein.
Hameroff discusses quantum information processing. Quantum superpositions where the
quantum waves represent multiple possibilities for the state of a particle, are known to persist
until quanta are either measured or naturally interact with the rest of the environment.
Hameroff takes the view that the original mainstream interpretation, Copenhagen
Interpretation, puts not only consciousness but the concept of reality itself outside physics.
Alternatives interpretations include the ‘many worlds’ view, where there is no collapse but the
superpositions continue in multiple worlds and David Bohm’s idea in which the quanta are
guided by active information.
It is important to stress that quantum computing as such is not expected to generate
consciousness. In quantum computers, which many researchers, are now trying to develop
quantum collapse will occur as a result of measurement or interaction with the environment. It
is only in the event of OR that non-computability and consciousness could be brought into
play.
Hameroff goes on to look at some of the detail of the theory that he and Penrose developed as
to how consciousness could be based in microtubules in the brain. It is suggested that
quantum compuations take place in microtubules orchestrated by the inputs of synapse via
MAPs. Hence the theory is often known as Orch OR for orchestrated objective reduction. The
computations are suggested to persist for 25 ms, which would link them to the 40Hz gamma
synchrony, viewed as a correlate of consciousness even in more mainstream theories. The
computations are terminated by objective reduction. It is proposed that in dendrites, the
tubulin sub-units of the microtubules interact by dipole coupling so as process information.
The tubulin conformation is governed by quantum London forces, so that the tubulins can
exist as quantum superpositions of different conformations. In superposition the tubulins
would be qbits in a quantum computer, computing by means of non-local entanglement with
other tubulin qbits. This entanglement would not just be with tubulins in the same
microtubule, but other microtubules in the same dendrite, and in other dendrites connected by
gap junctions. Neurons connected by gap junctions can be viewed as a single hyperneuron,
and the hyperneuron can be seen as a conventional neuron assembly.
The dendritic interiors alternate between two states as a result of the polymerisation of actin
protein. In the depolymerised form the interior of the neuron is aqueous and microtubules
60

signal and process information classically. There are synaptic inputs to the microtubules
during this phase. When actin polymerises the interior of the dendrite becomes quasi-solid of
gelatinous, and water near to the proteins becomes ordered as a result of the actin gelation.
Debye layers of counterions may also shield the microtubules, due to the charged C-termini
tails on the tubulins. This is suggested to make the microtubules sufficiently isolated from the
environment for quantum superposition to occur in the tubulins. The geometry of a quantum
computer lattice could be formed so as to be resistant to decoherence. Microtubules are
suggested to have a structure which is particularly suitable for error correction. Coherent
pumping of energy and quantum error correction may thus help to prevent decoherence.
Quantum error correction involves a code that can detect and correct decoheence in a
quantum system.
Hameroff claims to refute Tegmark’s attempt to disprove the Penrose/Hameroff model,
(Hagan, et al, 2002). This is significant as Tegmark’s criticism of Orch OR has been widely
accepted as a completely satisfactory dismissal of the theory, and responses to Tegmark are
habitualy ignored. Tegmark calculated microtubule decoherence time as being 10^-13 seconds,
which would certainly be much too short for any neural activity. However, he worked on the
basis of his own model for quantum activity in microtubules, which was never proposed by
Hameroff or anyone else, basing his calculation on a 24nm separation of solitons from
themselves along the microtubules, whereas Orch OR proposes a superposition separation
distance six orders of magnitude smaller. For some reason, Tegmark did not choose to address
the Penrose/Hameroff model. This invalidates his particular approach, whatever the truth is
about decoherence, but somehow it has not prevented his work from being quoted as an
absolutely reliable refutation of Orch OR (Hagan, et al, 2002).
A recent update of the Orch OR model
A recent review and update of this 20-year-old theory of consciousness published in Physics
of Life Reviews, 2013, persists to claim that consciousness derives from deeper level, finer
scale activities inside brain neurons. The recent discovery of quantum vibrations in
"microtubules" inside brain neurons corroborates this theory, according to review authors
Stuart Hameroff and Sir Roger Penrose. Thi groundbreaking article, and some of the
accompanying comments, are partly cited and summarized in the following:
“ Hameroff and Penrose suggest that EEG rhythms (brain waves) also derive from deeper
level microtubule vibrations, and that from a practical standpoint, treating brain microtubule
vibrations could benefit a host of mental, neurological, and cognitive conditions.
Orch OR was harshly criticized from its inception, as the brain was considered too "warm,
wet, and noisy" for seemingly delicate quantum processes. However, evidence has now shown
warm quantum coherence in plant photosynthesis, bird brain navigation, our sense of smell,
61

and brain microtubules. The recent discovery of warm temperature quantum vibrations in
microtubules inside brain neurons by the research group led by Anirban Bandyopadhyay,
2011 at the National Institute of Material Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan (and now at MIT),
corroborates the pair's theory and suggests that EEG rhythms also derive from deeper level
microtubule vibrations. In addition, work from the laboratory of Emerson and Eckenhoff et
al, 2013, at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that anesthesia, which selectively erases
consciousness while sparing non-conscious brain activities, acts via microtubules in brain
neurons.
"The origin of consciousness reflects our place in the universe, the nature of our existence. Did
consciousness evolve from complex computations among brain neurons, as most scientists
assert? Or has consciousness, in some sense, been here all along, as spiritual approaches
maintain?" ask Hameroff and Penrose in their current review. "This opens a potential
Pandora's Box, but our theory accommodates both these views, suggesting consciousness
derives from quantum vibrations in microtubules, protein polymers inside brain neurons,
which both govern neuronal and synaptic function, and connect brain processes to selforganizing processes in the fine scale, 'proto-conscious' quantum structure of reality
After 20 years of skeptical criticism, "the evidence now clearly supports Orch OR," continue
Hameroff and Penrose. " Our new paper updates the evidence, clarifies Orch OR quantum
bits, or "qubits," as helical pathways in microtubule lattices, rebuts critics, and reviews 20
testable predictions of Orch OR published in 1998 – of these, six are confirmed and none
refuted." An important new facet of the theory is introduced. Microtubule quantum vibrations
(e.g. in megahertz) appear to interfere and produce much slower EEG "beat frequencies."
Despite a century of clinical use, the underlying origins of EEG rhythms have remained a
mystery. Clinical trials of brief brain stimulation aimed at microtubule resonances with
megahertz mechanical vibrations using transcranial ultrasound have shown reported
improvements in mood, and may prove useful against Alzheimer's disease and brain injury in
the future.
Lead author Stuart Hameroff concludes, "Orch OR is the most rigorous, comprehensive and
successfully-tested theory of consciousness ever put forth. From a practical standpoint,
treating brain microtubule vibrations could benefit a host of mental, neurological, and
cognitive conditions."
The review is accompanied by eight commentaries from outside authorities, including an
Australian group of Orch OR arch-skeptics. To all, Hameroff and Penrose respond robustly.
They will engage skeptics in a debate on the nature of consciousness, and Bandyopadhyay and
his team will couple microtubule vibrations from active neurons to play Indian musical
instruments. "Consciousness depends on an anharmonic vibrations of microtubules inside
62

neurons, similar to certain kinds of Indian music, but unlike Western music which is
harmonic".
Hameroff explained that consciousness depends on biologically ‘orchestrated’ coherent
quantum processes in collections of microtubules within brain neurons, that these quantum
processes correlate with, and regulate, neuronal synaptic and membrane activity. The
continuous Schrödinger evolution of each such process is supposed to terminate in accordance
with the specific Diósi–Penrose (DP) scheme of ‘objective reduction’ (‘OR’) of the quantum
state. This orchestrated OR activity (‘Orch OR’) is taken to result in moments of conscious
awareness and/or choice. The DP form of OR is related to the fundamentals of quantum
mechanics and space–time geometry, so Orch OR suggests that there is a connection between
the brainʼs biomolecular processes and the basic structure of the universe. The authors recently
reviewed the Orch OR in light of criticisms and developments in quantum biology,
neuroscience, physics and cosmology (Hameroff and Penrose, 2012).
The authors introduce a novel suggestion of ‘beat frequencies’ of faster microtubule vibrations
as a possible source of the observed electro-encephalographic (‘EEG’) correlates of
consciousness. They conclude that consciousness plays an intrinsic role in the universe. The
group of Bandyopadhyay, 2011 has indeed discovered conductive resonances in single
microtubules that are observed when there is an applied alternating current at specific
frequencies in gigahertz, megahertz and kilohertz ranges. Electron dipole shifts do have some
tiny effect on nuclear positions via charge movements and Mossbauer recoil. A shift of one
nanometer in electron position might move a nearby carbon nucleus a few femtometers
(‘Fermi lengths’, i.e. 1 0 − 1 5 m 10−15 m), roughly its diameter. The effect of electron
spin/magnetic dipoles on nuclear location is less clear.(Fig.18)
Recent Orch OR publications have cast tubulin bits (and quantum bits, or qubits) as coherent
entangled dipole states acting collectively among electron clouds of aromatic amino acid rings,
with only femtometer conformational change due to nuclear displacement (Fig.13). As it turns
out, femtometer displacement might be sufficient for Orch OR/ Diósi–Penrose objective
reduction (DP) is a particular proposal for an extension of current quantum mechanics, taking
the bridge between quantum- and classical-level physics as a ‘quantum-gravitational’
phenomenon. This is in contrast with the various conventional viewpoints, whereby this
bridge is claimed to result, somehow, from ‘environmental decoherence’, or from ‘observation
by a conscious observer’, or from a ‘choice between alternative worlds’, or some other
interpretation of how the classical world of one actual alternative may be taken to arise out of
fundamentally quantum-superposed ingredients.

protein qubit used in OrchOR publications mainly from 1996 to 1998.On left ,tubulin oscillates between
2states with 1nanometer conformational flexing (10%tubulindiameter). On right, both state sexist in
quantum superposition. (Irrespective of the schematic cartoon the 1 nanometer displacement has never been
implemented in OrchORcalculations). The states are shown to correlate with electron locations(dipole

(b)Schematic cartoon version of the OrchOR qubit developed since 2002 (following identification of tubulin

indole rings per tubulin, with coupled, oscillating London force dipole orientations among rings traversing
‘quantum channels’ , aligning with rings in adjacent tubulins in helical pathways through microtubule
lattices. On the right, superposition of alternative tubulin and helical pathway dipole states. There is no
conformational flexing. Mechanical displacement occurs at the femtometer level of tubulin atomic nuclei
(not shown) . Reimers et al . continually, and exclusively, criticize the obsolete, non- implemented version
on left(a), and ignore the actual OrchOR dipole pathway qubit version on right(b).

The DP version of OR involves a different interpretation of the term ‘quantum gravity’ from
what is usual. Current ideas of quantum gravity (see, for example, Smolin, 2004, normally
refer, instead, to some sort of physical scheme that is to be formulated within the bounds of
standard quantum field theory—although no particular such theory, among the multitude that
has so far been put forward, has gained anything approaching universal acceptance, nor has
any of them found a fully consistent, satisfactory formulation. ‘OR’ here refers to the
alternative viewpoint that standard quantum (field) theory is not the final answer, and that the
reduction R of the quantum state (‘collapse of the wave function’) that is adopted in standard
quantum mechanics is an actual physical process which is not part of the conventional unitary
64

formalism U of quantum theory (or quantum field theory). In the DP version of OR, the
reduction R of the quantum state does not arise as some kind of convenience or effective
consequence of environmental decoherence, etc., as the conventional U formalism would seem
to demand, but is instead taken to be one of the consequences of melding together the
principles of Einsteinʼs general relativity with those of the conventional unitary quantum
formalism U, and this demands a departure from the strict rules of U. According to this OR
viewpoint, any quantum measurement—whereby the quantum-superposed alternatives
produced in accordance with the U formalism becomes reduced to a single actual
occurrence—is a real objective physical process, and it is taken to result from the mass
displacement between the alternatives being sufficient, in gravitational terms, for the
superposition to become unstable.
It is helpful to have a conceptual picture of quantum superposition in a gravitational context.
According to modern accepted physical theories, reality is rooted in 3-dimensional space and a
1-dimensional time, combined together into a 4-dimensional space–time. This space–time is
slightly curved, in accordance with Einsteinʼs general theory of relativity, in a way which
encodes the gravitational fields of all distributions of mass density. Each different choice of
mass density effects a space–time curvature in a different, albeit a very tiny, way. This is the
standard picture according to classical physics. On the other hand, when quantum systems have
been considered by physicists, this mass-induced tiny curvature in the structure of space–time
has been almost invariably ignored, gravitational effects having been assumed to be totally
insignificant for normal problems in which quantum theory is important. Surprising as it may
seem, however, such tiny differences in space–time structure can have large effects, for they
entail subtle but fundamental influences on the very rules of quantum mechanics’.
The initial part of each space–time is at the upper left of each individual space–time diagram,
and so the bifurcating space–time diagram on right moving downward and rightward
illustrates two alternative mass distributions evolving in time, their space–time curvature
separation increasing. mechanically (so long as OR has not taken place), the ‘physical reality’
of this situation, as provided by the evolving wavefunction, is being illustrated as an actual
superposition of these two slightly differing space–time manifolds,The OR process is
considered to occur when quantum superpositions between such slightly differing space–
times take place differing from one another by an integrated space–time measure which
compares with the fundamental and extremely tiny Planck (4-volume) scale of space–time
geometry. As remarked above, this is a 4-volume Planck measure, involving both time and
space, so we find that the time measure would be particularly tiny when the space-difference
measure is relatively large (as with Schrödingerʼs hypothetical cat), but for extremely tiny
space-difference measures, the time measure might be fairly long. For example, an isolated
single electron in a superposed state (very low E G EG) might reach OR threshold only after
65

thousands of years or more, whereas if Schrödingerʼs (∼10 kg) cat were to be put into a
superposition, of life and death, this threshold could be reached in far less than even the
Planck time of 1 0 − 4 3 s 10−43 s.(Fig.19)

Fig. 19: As superposition curvature E reaches threshold, OR occurs and one particle location/curvature
is selected, and becomes classical. The other ceases to exist.

In the situations under consideration here, where we expect a conscious brain to be at far from
zero temperature, and because technological quantum computers require zero temperature, it
is very reasonable to question quantum brain activities. Nevertheless, it is now well known
that superconductivity and other large-scale quantum effects can actually occur at
temperatures very far from absolute zero. Indeed, biology appears to have evolved thermal
mechanisms to promote quantum coherence. Ouyang and Awschalom, 2003 showed that
quantum spin transfer through phenyl ring π orbital resonance clouds (the same as those in
protein hydrophobic regions, as illustrated in Fig.14, are enhanced at increasingly warm
temperatures. Spin flip currents through microtubule pathways, , may be directly analogous.)
In the past 6 years, evidence has accumulated that plants routinely use quantum coherent
electron transport at ambient temperatures in photosynthesis Engel et al, 2007 and Hildner,
2013. Photons are absorbed in one region of a photosynthetic protein complex, and their
energy is conveyed by electronic excitations through the protein to another region to be
converted to chemical energy to make food. In this transfer, electrons utilize multiple
pathways simultaneously, through π electron clouds in a series of chromophores (analogous to
hydrophobic regions) spaced nanometers apart, maximizing efficiency (e.g. via so-called
‘exciton hopping’). Chromophores in photosynthesis proteins appear to enable electron
quantum conductance precisely like aromatic rings are proposed in Orch OR to function in
tubulin and microtubules.
Quantum conductance through photosynthesis protein is enhanced by mechanical vibration,
and microtubules appear to have their own set of mechanical vibrations (e.g. in megahertz as
suggested by Sahu et al., 2013. Megahertz mechanical vibrations is ultrasound, and brief, low
intensity (sub-thermal) ultrasound administered through the skull to the brain modulates
electrophysiology, behavior and affect, e.g. improved mood in patients suffering from chronic
pain, perhaps by direct excitation of brain microtubules
66

Further research has shown warm quantum effects in bird-brain navigation, Gaucher et
al,2011, ion channels Benroider and Roy, 2005 , sense of smell Turin, 1996 , DNA, Rieper,
2011, protein folding, Luo and Lu, 2011, and biological water, Reiter, 2013 (see also the
reviews of Arndt, 2009 and Lloyd, 2011 on these aspects). What about quantum effects in
microtubules? In the 1980s and 1990s, theoretical models predicted ‘Fröhlich’ gigahertz
coherence and ferroelectric effects in microtubules. In 2001 and 2004, coherent megahertz
emissions were detected from living cells and ascribed to microtubule dynamics (powered by
mitochondrial electromagnetic fields) by the group of Jiri Pokorný in Prague .
Beginning in 2009, Anirban Bandyopadhyay and colleagues at the National Institute of
Material Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan, were able to use nanotechnology to address electronic
and optical properties of individual microtubules (Sahu et al, 2013 a,b). The group has made a
series of remarkable discoveries suggesting that quantum effects do occur in microtubules at
biological temperatures. First, they found that electronic conductance along microtubules,
normally extremely good insulators, becomes exceedingly high, approaching quantum
conductance, at certain specific resonance frequencies of applied alternating current (AC)
stimulation. These resonances occur in gigahertz, megahertz and kilohertz ranges, and are
particularly prominent in low megahertz (e.g. 8.9 MHz). Conductances induced by specific
(e.g. megahertz) AC frequencies appear to follow several types of pathways through the
microtubule—helical, linear along the microtubule axis, and ‘blanket-like’ along/around the
entire microtubule surface. Second, using various techniques, the Bandyopadhyay group also
determined AC conductance through 25-nm-wide microtubules is greater than through single
4-nm-wide tubulins, indicating cooperative, possibly quantum coherent effects throughout the
microtubule, and that the electronic properties of microtubules are programmed within each
tubulin. Their results also showed that conductance increased with microtubule length,
indicative of quantum mechanisms (Fig. 20).

Fig.20: Top: Tentatively proposed picture of a conscious event by quantum computing in one of a vast
number of microtubules all acting coherently so that there is sufficient mass displacement for Orch OR
to take place. Tubulins are in classical dipole states (yellow or blue), or quantum superposition of
both dipole states (gray). Quantum superposition/computation evolves during integration phases (1–3)
in integrate-and-fire brain neurons, increasing quantum superposition E G EG (gray tubulins) until
threshold is met, at which time a conscious moment occurs, and tubulin states are selected which
regulate firing and control conscious behavior. Middle: Corresponding alternative superposed space–
time curvatures reaching threshold at the moment of OR and selecting one space–time curvature.
Bottom: Schematic of a conscious Orch OR event showing U-like evolution of quantum superposition

The resonance conductance (‘Bandyopadhyay coherence’ – ‘BC’) through tubulins and
microtubules is consistent with the intra-tubulin aromatic ring pathways (Fig. 13), which can
support Orch OR quantum dipoles, and in which anesthetics bind, apparently to selectively
erase consciousness. Bandyopadhyayʼs experiments do seem to provide clear evidence for
coherent microtubule quantum states at brain temperature. This said, solid scientific evidence
(microtubules and the rest) is not yet completely convincing and one is left with the desire to
contribute to the whole intellectual construction in order, not to leave it in its present state.
Anyhow, certain parts of the mosaic are particularly appealing: the fact for instance that
anesthetic gas exert their effects on consciousness, and that actual evidence from genomics and
proteomics point to anesthetic action in microtubules. As Faraday said, it is always better to
have a partial vision of the facts rather than having none.
68

Some could, on the contrary, be fully convinced of the existence and function of objective
reductions of the quantum states occurring in and orchestrated by biological structures. Of
these, microtubules would represent the most efficient and evolutionary winning example,
consciousness being the most visible of its non-epiphenomenal phenotypes. As a novel
suggestion relative to their previous studies, “beat frequencies” are introduced by Hameroff
and Penrose as a possible source of the observed electro-encephalographic (EEG) correlates of
consciousness.
Introducing quantum physics into the realm of biology entails another major positive aspect:
room is made for Darwinism and Chance-and-Necessity reasoning. Biological structures as
microtubules evolved (well within Darwinian logics) which occurred to cause objective
reduction of the quantum state. Once Darwin enters the scene, everything becomes possible.
Our mind provides the a posteriori verification. For a deeper look at this concept, the reader is
referred to the elaboration of the terms“Ereignis” and “Ereignen” by Martin Heidegger. The
basic Hameroff and Penrose assumption would in this case objectively become of paramount
importance. The Hameroff–Penrose form of orchestrated objective reduction( Hameroff and
Penrose, 2011, 2013) is related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and space–time
geometry. Hence the connection between the basic structure of the Universe and biomolecular
processes. Relating these effects to neurons might appear an unjustified self-inflicted limitation
and, in this perspective, the general conclusion should not be avoided: consciousness is a
property and a manifestation of life, life is universal in principle. Thus, consciousness is in
principle universal”.
A note of caution: Roger Penrose himself recently said: “I donʼt see why we should take
quantum mechanics as sacrosanct. I think thereʼs going to be something else which replaces
it”. These words, if they can be considered as not being out-of-context, find their explanation
in the incompleteness of quantum theory. The awareness of this incompleteness is at the very
basis of the Orch OR Theory and is reappearing throughout this important essay.

Hiroomi Umezawa and Herbert Frohlich: Quantum Brain Dynamics

Hiroomi Umezawa

Herbert Fröhlich

The basic concept in quantum brain dynamics (QBD) is that the electrical dipoles of the water
molecules in the brain constitute a cortical field. The quanta of this field are described as
corticons. The field interacts with quantum coherent waves propagating along the neuronal
network. There is more than one view within QBD as to how this system supports or
instantiates consciousness.
The ideas behind quantum brain dynamics (QBD) derived originally from the physicists,
Hiroomi Umezawa and Herbert Frohlich in the 1960s. In the last 20 years, these ideas have
been elaborated and given greater prominence by the combined efforts of Japanese physicists,
Mari Jibu and Kunio Yasue, 1992, 1993 and the Italian physicist, Giuseppe Vitiello, 1995,
2001.
Iain Stuart, Umezawa and Yasushi Takahashi (1978) proposed the idea of a cortical field in
the brain. Water comprises 70% of the brain, and QBD proposes that rather than providing a
passive background, water could be an active player in brain processes. Water molecules have
a constant electric dipole, and are considered in QBD to be capable of interacting with waves
generated by biomolecules that are also electrical dipoles.
In QBD, the totality of the water molecules in the brain is viewed as the best candidate for a
cortical field, with the water’s electrical dipoles binding both to one another and to the
biomolecules of the neuronal network. There are also suggested to be long-range waves within
the cortical field. The quanta of the cortical field are given the name of corticons, and in Jibu
and Yasue’s version of the theory, the interaction between the cortical field and the neuronal
network, particularly the dendritic part of that network, is the basis of consciousness.
The other half of the theory refers to biomolecules propagating through the neuronal network,
an idea deriving from the work of Frohlich, 1968. Frohlich argued that it was not clear how
order was sustained in living systems, given the likely disrupting effect of the fluctuations in
70

biochemical processes (Frohlich, 1985). His ideas relate mainly to the ordering of the neuronal
network, on which the proposed cortical network of Umezawa is proposed to act.
Frohlich saw the electric potential across the cell membrane as the macroscopic observable of
an underlying quantum order. Frohlich’s studies claim to show that with oscillating electrical
charges in a thermal bath, a large number of quanta may become condensed into a single state,
known as a Bose condensate, allowing long-range correlations amongst the dipoles involved.
He also proposed that biomolecules with a high electric dipole moment line up along the actin
filaments, and that electric dipole oscillations propagate along these filaments in the form of
quantum coherent waves. There is some support for these ideas, in the form of experimental
confirmation that biomolecules with high electric dipole moment have a periodic oscillation
(Gray and Singer, 1989).

Fig.21: The hypothesis of an individual double as created by our mind
Vitiello agrees with Frohlich in arguing that living systems constitute ordered chains of
chemical reactions, which could normally be expected to collapse in the random chemical
environment of biological tissue. In Vitiello’s view stable ordering comes from the quantum
level, but this is described by quantum field theory rather than quantum mechanics. He also
claims that the folding of protein, which is fundamental to the activity of cells, cannot be
described by classical physics, but could be quantum ordered. Vitiello, 1995, 2001 provides
citations, which he feels support a quantum dynamical view of biological tissue, notably
studies of radiation effects on cell growth, on electromagnetic fields and stress, on dynamical
response to external stimuli, on non-linear tunnelling, on coherent nuclear motion in

membrane proteins, on optical coherence in biological systems, on weak radiation fields and
biological systems by (Popp, 1986) and on energy transfer via solitons and coherent
excitations. QBD proposes that the cortical field not only interacts with, but also to a good
extent controls the neuronal network. It suggests that biomolecular waves propagate along the
actin filaments, an important part of the cytoskeleton, particularly in the vicinity of the cell
membrane and dendritic spines. The waves derive energy from ATP molecules stored in the
membrane, and these in turn are controlled by calcium ions. These waves are also suggested to
control the action of ion channels, which are crucial in the transmission of signals to the
synapses.. The neurons membrane is further suggested to act as a Josephson junction
providing insulation between two layers of superconductivity. The superconductivity current
across the membrane can be controlled by the electrical potentials across the same membrane.
Vitiello also discusses the question of quantum decoherence. He claims that QBD only requires
quantum oscillations to last 10-14 picoseconds, which should be much shorter than the period
required for decoherence ( Del Giudice, 1988, 2002). In common with Stuart Hameroff, he
additionally argues that ordered water around protein molecules may shield them from the
surrounding thermal bath.
A decisive further step in developing the approach has been achieved by taking dissipation into
account. Dissipation is possible when the interaction of a system with its environment is
considered. Vitiello (1995) describes how the system-environment interaction causes a
doubling of the collective modes of the system in its environment (Fig.21). This yields
infinitely many differently coded vacuum states, offering the possibility of many memory
contents without overprinting. Finally, dissipation generates a genuine arrow of time for the
system, and its interaction with the environment induces entanglement. In a recent
contribution, Pessa and Vitiello (2003) have addressed additional effects of chaos and
quantum noise.

Mari Jibu & Kunio Yasue: Quantum field concepts

Jibu and Yasue (1992, 1993) appear to see consciousness as simply a function of the interaction
of the corticons, the energy quanta which are proposed to arise in the cortical field, with the
biomolecular waves of the neuronal network. Vitiello, while thinking in terms of much the
same quantum systems as Jibu and Yasue, proposes that these quantum states produce two
poles, first a subjective representation of the external world and secondly a self, which opens
itself to this representation of the external world. According to Vitiello’s version of the theory,
consciousness is not strictly speaking in either the self or the external representation but
between the two, in the opening of one to the other.
The concepts derive from the Japanese physicist, Hiroomi Umezawa, 1993 who speculated
that understanding the processes of memory in the brain would involve quantum field theory.
This led onto the idea that understanding consciousness would also involve quantum field
theory. The first four chapters of their book in 1993 provide a standard background to
quantum theory and neuroscience. Those without some grounding would be better advised to
look at more standard text books or popularizations, as the style of the book is generally
difficult and unnecessarily repetitive. The first four chapters of the book deal with quantum
theory. For those not familiar with this, there are many much more comprehensible
descriptions. This is followed by some descriptive passages on the brain, which is again better
described elsewhere.
Getting beyond these introductory stages, the authors make the same point as others in
stressing the estrangement between physics, where fundamental new views of nature
emerged during the last hundred years and neuroscience which has remained largely wedded
to 19th century physics. In particular physics has tended to think dynamically, in terms of
controlled changes. Physics deals primarily with the inanimate, but the concepts of dynamics
can be applied to living organisms, as they also undergo controlled changes. The authors
suggest that the functions of the cortex might be better understood through the dendritic
network, by which information enters cells. They stress that many neurons in the cortex do not
have axons but only dendrites. They think that the conventional processing system described
in the axon-neurotransmitter-dendrite system may overlook other networks in the brain.
Neurons without axons are the majority in the cortex and the authors see these as the likely
basis of consciousness.

73

Fig.22: Schematic representation of the synapse and synaptic cleft with the element of quantum
tunneling of electrons(a) and dendritic network (b)

The authors discuss the dendritic network at length. They point out that it is much more
sophisticated than the axonal network (Fig. 18). The dendritic membrane comprises
biomolecules with electric dipoles, the positive poles of the membrane are aligned on the inner
surface and the negative poles on the outer surface. The negative poles on the outer surface
attract positive ions, while the positive poles on the inner surface attract negative ions. The
regions where these interactions occur are called Debye layers. The dendrites of several
neurons are often entangled in a network. Chemical synapses are located on the tips of
dendritic spines and there are emphases on the dendritic membranes. In such processes even
quantum tunneling may play a significant role (Fig.22).
Since the 1970s, Evan Harris Walker has proposed that quantum tunneling of electrons would take
place across junctions between Neurons. Stuart Hameroff says that "... Gap junctions enable quantum
tunneling among dendrites ...".According to principles of modern physics: if a particle such as an
electron encounters a barrier such as the synaptic junction, there is a finite probability that the particle
will ... be found on the other side ... From the point of view of Bohm’s pilot wave quantum theory,
Peter R. Holland says that quantum tunneling is explained because the effective barrier potential is not
the classical barrier potential , but is is the quantum potential. From the many-worlds point of view,
quantum tunneling means that the electron is in a superposition of position states, some of which are

74

on one side of the junction and some of which are on the other side. Therefore quantum tunneling can
also allow quantum superposition states to extend from neuron to neuron across gap junctions.

There is experimental confirmation that biomolecules of high electric dipole moment have a
periodic oscillation (Fröhlich, 1968). The authors suggest that these oscillations are crucial to
the functioning of the brain. This can be called wave cybernetics, because the wave or
biomolecule oscillation is seen as the controlling factor in the brain.
Frohlich proposed a theory where biomolecules with high electric dipole moment line up
along the actin filaments immediately below the cell membrane, while electric dipole
oscillations propagate along each filament as coherent waves. These are maintained by
electrons trapped in and moving along the protein molecules. This is now known as a Frohlich
wave. These waves exchange energy with the electromagnetic field. Stuart, Umezawa, and
Takahashi, 1978 proposed the idea of a cortical field. This interacts with the macroscopic
dynamics of the main neural network, which in turn transmits signals to the body tissues. The
filamentous strings found in the cells also extend outside the cells forming an extracellular
matrix that is also linked to the cell membrane. So the membrane proteins are linked both to
the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.

Fig.23: Cartoons of, so called, Bose –Einstein conjugates
The authors propose that Fröhlich waves propagate along the filamentous strings. The waves
are produced by energy stored in ATP molecules at membrane protein sites, which are in turn
controlled by calcium ions. The waves also effect the operation of ion channels, which control
neural impulses. The authors suggest that this structure can give rise to a macroscopic
quantum phenomena, similar to superconductivity. They also regard the cell membrane as an
75

insulating layer between two areas of superconductivity, otherwise known as a Josephson
junction. This means that superconductivity current across the Josephson Junction can be
controlled by electric potential differences in the insulating layer.
The authors suggest that this quantum activity may facilitate the functioning of the brain and
in particular an interface between the proposed cortical field and the neurons network. The
cortical field is proposed to contain energy quanta behaving as particles, which the authors
call corticons. Corticons are suggested to exist everywhere in the cerebral cortex. The interface
between the cortical field and the neuron network takes place in the waves propagating along
the filamentous strings in the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
The authors emphasize the nature and importance of water within the brain. They suggest that
water is not just a background substance, but is an active component in cell assemblies. This
idea lies behind the original concept of the cortical field and corticons. The water molecule has
a constant electrical dipole. It also has a symmetrical form that is invariant under reflection.
The molecule rotates around its symmetry axis, which is the electrical dipole. Thus the
molecule is a quantum mechanical spinning top, which interacts with the fields generated by
biomolecules.
The totality of water molecules in the brain is seen as the best candidate for the sought for
cortical field. In water, one side of the molecule becomes negatively charged, and one side
positively charged creating an electric dipole. This is an attraction between molecules known
as hydrogen bonding. The attraction is both between water molecules and between water
molecules and other molecules with electrical dipoles. Biomolecules such as proteins have
constant electric dipoles and connect to water molecules.
The cortical field is identified with the water rotational field, created by the spinning dipoles
of the water molecules. The field on the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix is proposed to be
a Bose field (Fig. 23), and the interaction between this Bose field and the corticons of the
cortical field is seen as the basis of consciousness. Corticons are identified with the energy
quanta of the water rotational field of the brain. The corticons interact with each other by
emitting and absorbing the exchange bosons of the Bose field, and are themselves the energy
quanta of the water rotational field. The water rotational field is a dipole field and therefore
interacts with an electromagnetic field. There are also suggested to be long-range correlation
waves in the water rotational field of the brain.
The brain structures described here are thought to be sensitive to and to modify themselves in
responses to information coming into the brain. The combined dynamics of the cortical field
and the electromagnetic field comprise what the authors describe as quantum brain dynamics
(QBD). The dynamics of the corticons is thought to be capable of controlling the dendritic and
76

neural networks. The authors think that the creation and annillation of corticons in the QBD is
what is called consciousness.
Unfortunately the authors do not explain why they think this, and therefore like more
mainstream theories of consciousness, the actual consciousness seems to be created by fiat.
There is no more apparent reason why consciousness should arise from this physical
interaction than from the physical interaction of electrical potentials and chemical in the
synapses. The authors could have suggested that consciousness was a fundamental property
of photons or of the proposed corticons or of particular fields but they do not do this.

Johnjoe McFadden: Electromagnetic fields in brain

McFadden starts by stating that synchronous firing in the brain correlates with awareness and
perception indicating that disturbances in the brain’s electromagnetic field also correlate with
these. This field is a representation of neuronal information and its dynamics could be seen as
a correlate of consciousness. McFadden, 2001 views this field as the physical substrata of
consciousness. Popper, 1997 and Libet, 2006 have both suggested that consciousness might
derive from an overarching field that could integrate the processing of neurons, but they did
not think that this could be any known physical field. At the same time, there has been
considerable interest in synchronous firing of neurons. Awareness has been shown to correlate
with the synchrony of firing in the 40-80Hz range, and this may bind together neurons
involved in different aspects of the same visual perception, thus creating the unity of
consciousness (Fig.24).
The brain’s electromagnetic field is induced by neuron firing, and also the movement of ions
involved in the fluctuation of electrical potential along the cell membrane. The structure of the
cortex tends to amplify the induced field. Experiments in the olfactory bulb have
demonstrated EEG activity in response to sensory stimuli. Information about the stimuli
related to the spatial pattern of the EEG amplitude.

77

The author concludes that the brain contains a highly structured extracellular electromagnetic
field. The field is weak with the trans membrane fields being about 3,000 times stronger. It is
suggested that neurotransmission through gap junctions may be voltage dependent and
therefore sensitive to local fields. However, McFadden prefers to concentrate on the voltagegated ion channels in the cell membranes, because their role is better understood. Synchonous
firing is thought to due to a large number of spatially distributed neurons. It is thought that
many millions of neurons could be influenced by such firing. McFadden claims evidence for
neuron communication via the electromagnetic field.

Fig. 24: The electromagnetic field theory of consciousness as part of an integral electromagnetic
spectrum

The medical use of trans cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is taken to indicate the sensitivity
of the brain to weak electromagnetic fields, and as this has impacts on behavior, it is argued to
impact neuronal computation and neuronal function Even when fields are weaker than the
surrounding noise, they can modulate neurons. The brain’s electromagnetic field is argued to
hold the same information as the neuron firing patterns. The widespread of the
electromagnetic field would help to explain the unity of consciousness.
78

Clusters of neurons in the visual cortex have been shown to fire in synchrony in response to
particular stimuli. With insects, destruction of synchronous firing has been shown to reduce
the ability to discriminate between stimuli. There is indirect evidence for the correlation
between synchronous firing and attention and awareness in humans. The olfactory system of
rabbits shows that the sensory information is encoded in the spatial pattern of the EEG, and
therefore of the electromagnetic field. This correlation also reflected what a particular smell
meant to the rabbit, when it had been trained to associate particular things with a smell. This
suggested that the shape of the electromagnetic field could be related to perception and
meaning. This is taken to suggest that consciousness is related to the electromagnetic field.
Where there is habituation with a process and therefore less conscious activity there is a
reduction in synchronous firing, so loss of awareness correlates with reduced disturbance in
the brain’s electromagnetic field. The theory predicts that only activity that acts on the motor
neurons is conscious. This is testable, although there is no direct evidence. The EEG shows that
activity increases during creative thinking, declines with sleep but revives with REM
dreaming, so the amount of conscious activity correlates with the amount of electromagnetic
activity.
The high conductivity of the cerebral fluid in the brain ventricles makes the brain into a kind
of Faraday’s cage, insulating it from external electrical fields. However, it is much easier for
magnetic fields to penetrate the brain and other tissues. Moving magnetic fields, such as those
used in TMS do produce effects in the brain.
Mc Fadden and the function of consciousness
McFadden sides with those who argue that consciousness must have a function or evolution
would not have selected for it. Field effects that had an advantageous effect on the
performance of ion channels would have been selected for. McFadden thinks that there is
information transfer between neurons during synchronous firing. He proposes that the neural
circuits involved in conscious and unconscious activity differ in their sensitivity to the
electromagnetic field. The conscious will is claimed to be our experience of the electromagnetic
field. He thinks that consciousness is not actually the electromagnetic field, but its ability to
transmit information to neurons. He also points out the difficulty of trying to perform two
conscious tasks or a conscious and unconscious task at the same time. The two interfere with
each other, while unconscious multi-tasking is possible.
Consciousness is required for the laying down of long-term memories and for most learning.
The Cemi field theory conceives that the electromagnetic field in the brain fine tunes the
probabilities of neuron firings. The affected neurons may be part of large connected
assemblies, and this leads to memory and learning. In simulated networks non-synaptic
neuronal interactions via the elctromagnetic field and also gap junctions enhance learning.
79

Modulation of long term potentiation by electromagnetic fields has also been demonstrated in
vitro in rat hippocampal slices.
McFadden and Free will
The author claims that free will is the subjective experience of the influence of the cemi field on
neurons. However, the influence of the cemi field is seen as entirely deterministic. The
fluctuations in the field that are capable of modulating the firing of neurons would all be
generated by changing patterns of electrical activity, while the neurons themselves induce the
field. The author admits that there might be some element of random quantum fluctuations in
the field, but this randomness is unsuitable for producing free will.
The author, in common with others in consciousness studies, tries to have it both ways at this
point. The functioning of the brain is claimed to be entirely deterministic, but something called
‘will’ is active in driving our conscious actions. This appears to be a clear a contradiction, since
the whole idea of will is an agent which initiates something of its own accord.
The Cemi theory is trying to provide a plausible explanation of consciousness. The author
could have said that consciousness was a fundamental property of electrical charge, or
individual charged particles, or the photons that intermediate it, thus making it a primitive or
a brute fact of the universe. But he does not do this. He says that our conscious will is our
experience of the influence of the Cemi field. This seems to raise a host of questions and
contradictions. If the Cemi field isn’t conscious itself, who or what is experiencing it’s
influence. This suggests a dualistic non-physical entity that experiences the action of the field.
Even if we are happy with this concept it is not clear why this particular set of electromagnetic
fields should produce this experience for this entity.
Like many before him, McFadden suddenly declares by fiat that one particular part of the
otherwise ordinary material of the brain produces consciousness. Again, it is reasonable to say
that evolution selected for a particular type of field that could fine tune the neurons, but the
additional production of a feeling of free will, which is false has no demonstrable value.

Gustav Bernroider: Ion channel coherence

80

Ion channels are a crucial component in the axonal spiking/synaptic firing model of neuronal
signaling and information processing. The axonal signal starts from the body of the neuron
and proceeds down an extension called the axon, by means of a fluctuation in the difference in
electrical potential across the membrane that forms the exterior of the axon. The membrane is
formed by a double layer of lipids. The ion channels consist of protein molecules inserted
through the lipid bi-layer. The axon fires when sodium (Na+) ions flow in through one set of
ion channels, and subsequently returns to its resting state when potassium (K+) ions flow out
through another set of ion channels. This process continues down the length of the axon until
it reaches the synapse, which it allows to fire, and thus communicate with other neurons. Ion
channels are thus a key mechanism in the brain’s signaling and information processing (see
Fig. 25).

Fig. 25 : The potassium channel structure that protects the K+-ion from decoherence (above)
and the flow of quantum information through entangled series of channels.
Bernroider and Roy, 2004, 2005 base this theory on recent studies of ion channels. These have
been made possible by advances in high-resolution atomic-level spectroscopy and
accompanying molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, they draw particularly on the
work of the MacKinnon group, and on studies of the potassium (K+) channel, especially the
closed state of this channel. The functioning of the K+ channel occurs in two stages, firstly, the
selection of K+ ions in preference to any other species of ion, and secondly voltage-gating that
controls the flow of these favored K+ ions. The authors say that the traditional understanding
81

of both functions has been altered by the recent studies. In its closed state, the channel is now
seen to stabilise three K+ ions, two in the permeation filter of the ion channel and one in a
water cavity to the intracellular side of this permeation path. In the case of the channel’s
voltage gating, the electrical charges involved which were previously thought to act
independently of the surrounding proteins and lipids, are now seen to be coupled to these
proteins and lipids, and are thus involved in the gating process.
Atomic-level spectroscopy has revealed the detailed structure of the K+ channel in its closed
state. The filter region of the channel has a framework of five sets of four oxygen atoms, which
are each part of the carboxyl group of an amino-acid molecule in the surrounding protein.
These are referred to as binding pockets, involving eight oxygen atoms in total. Both ions in
the channel oscillate between two configurations (Fig. 21) .
Bernroider and Roy’s calculations lead them to claim that ion permeation can only be
understood at the quantum level. Taking this as an initial assumption, they go on to ask
whether the resulting model of the ion channel can be related to logic states. Their calculations
suggest that the K+ ions and the carboxyl atoms of the binding pockets are two quantumentangled sub-systems, and they equate this to a quantum computational mapping. The K+
ions that are destined to be expelled from the channel could, in the authors hypothesis, encode
information about the state of the oxygen atoms in the axon membrane .
In a later paper, presented at the Quantum Mind conference, Bernroider, 2007, proposed that
different ion channels could be non-locally entangled, thus proposing a quantum process over
an extended area of the axon. Given the importance of the ion channels in brain functioning,
this model would give quantum coherence and non-locality in the axon membrane an integral
role in the brain’s signalling and information processing.
Further to this, Bernroider and Roy have pointed out a similarity between the structure of the
K+ ion channel and some recent proposals for building quantum computers, in which ions are
held in microscopic traps.
The authors argue that their model is well protected against decoherence, which has always
been the most cogent criticism of quantum consciousness proposals. In particular, they claim
that Tegmark’s calculations do not apply to their model. The authors agree that for ions
moving freely in water, Tegmark’s coherence time of 10^20 seconds would apply. However,
they argue that the situation of the ions held in the permeation filter of the ion channel is
markedly different, with a temperature about half the prevailing level for the brain, and the
ions protected from decoherence by the binding pockets and the adjoining water cavity .
Bernroider and Roy propose a quantum information system in the brain that is driven by the
entangled ion states in the voltage-gated ion channels. These ion channels, situated in the
82

neuron’s membrane are a crucial component of the conventional neuroscience description of
axon spiking leading to neural transmitter release at the synapses. The ion channels allow the
influx and outflux of ions from the cell driving the fluctuation of electrical potential along the
axon, which in turn provides the necessary signal to the synapse.
The authors concentrate their attention on the potassium (K+) channel and in particular the
configuration of this channel when it is in the closed state. This channel is traditionally seen as
having the function of resetting the membrane potential from a firing to a resting state. This is
achieved by positively charged potassium (K+) ions flowing out of the neuron through the
channel.
Recent progress in atomic-level spectroscopy of the membrane proteins that constitute the ion
channels and the accompanying molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the organisation
of the membrane proteins carries a logical coding potency, and also implies quantum
entanglement within ion channels and possibly also between different ion channels. An
increasing number of studies show that proteins surrounding membrane lipids are associated
with the probabilistic nature of the gating of the ion channels (Fig.25 and 27).

Fig. 26 : Crystallographic X-ray determined structure of a potassium channel (a) and a
schematic representation of it showing the polypeptide units (b)
The authors draw particularly on the work of MacKinnon and his group, notably his
crystallographic X-ray work, see Fig. 26. The study shows that ions are coordinated by
carboxyl based oxygen atoms or by water molecules. An ion channel can be in either a closed
or an open state, and in the closed state there are two ions in the permeation path that are
83

confined there. The authors regard this closed gate arrangement as the essential feature with
regard to their research work. The open gate presents very little resistance to the flow of
potassium ions, but the closed gate is a stable ion-protein configuration.
The ion channel serves two functions, selecting K+ ions as the ones that will be given access
through the membrane, and then voltage-gating the flow of the permitted K+ ions. In the
authors’ view, recent studies also require a change in views both of the ion permeation and of
the voltage-gating process. A charge transfer carried by amino acids is involved in the gating
process. In the traditional model the charges were completely independent, whereas in the
new model there is coupling with the lipids that lie next to the channel proteins. This view,
which came originally from MacKinnon, is now supported by other more recent studies . The
authors think that the new gating models are more likely to support computational activity,
than were the traditional models.
As mentioned above, three potassium ions would be involved in the ion channel’s closed
configuration. Two of these are trapped in the permeation path of the protein, when the
channel gate is closed. The filter region of the ion channel is indicated by the recent studies to
have five binding pockets in the form of five sets of four carboxyl related oxygen atoms. Each
of the two trapped potassium ion are bound to eight of the oxygen atoms, i.e. each of them are
bound to two out of the five binding pockets. The author’s calculations predict that the
trapped ions will oscillate many times before the channel re-opens, and the calculations also
suggest an entangled state between the potassium ions and the binding oxygen atoms. This
structure is seen as being delicately balanced and sensitive to small fluctuations in the external
field. This sensitivity is viewed as possibly being able to account for the observed variations in
cortical responses.
Bernroider’s theory might be seen to represent even more of a challenge to conventional
neuroscience than the other quantum consciousness theories. This is because its recruits as its
basis the axon membrane and ion channels which form a crucial part of the conventional
neuroscience model, and then tries to remodel these core structures on a quantum-driven
basis. It is hard to deny that if this theory were to become better substantiated, it would
produce in neuroscience a revolution of the most profound kind.
The essential question was how selectivity could be maintained without compromising
conductance. The interaction between ions, attracted water molecules and neighbouring
oxygen atoms is considered to require a quantum description. This raises the question of
whether quantum effects can propagate in the classical states of proteins. The access of ions to
the pore gate is a relatively slow process not likely to require quantum processing.

84

However, the selectivity filter can change its conformation from permissive to non-permissive
on a much shorter timescale. It appears that in the conditions of the selectivity filter the ion’s
wave function can become highly delocalized over a significant part of the filter region.

A New Theory of Quantum Consciousness?
Bernroider’s theory could potentially be a vehicle for transferring consciousness from the
implicate into the explicate order of David Bohm. Bernroider differs from Penrose and
Hameroff’s Orch OR model in his emphasis of the axons and membranes, as opposed to the
dendrites and the cytoskeleton. However, there are similarities between the two models in that
both of them propose quantum coherence, non-locality and subsequent wave function collapse
linked to the brain’s macroscopic information processing activity. As it stands, Bernroider’s
proposals only deal with information processing in the brain rather than consciousness as
such. However, it appears possible that wave function collapse in the ion channels might link
to Penrose’s proposed geometry of space time, just as readily as wave function collapse in the
cytoskeleton (Fig. 27).
Bernroider’s theory is distinct from all earlier quantum consciousness theories in locating its
mechanism in structures that are central to mainstream theories of the brain’s information
processing and production of consciousness. If future experimentation were to substantiate
kind the Bernroider proposals, this would involve a revolution in neuroscience of the most
profound character.

Chris King: Cosmology, consciousness, chaos and fractal geometry

Chris King, 1989, 2003 2011, 2012, 2014, favors the approach of Chalmers over the approach of
Dennett in looking at the problem of consciousness. He describes Dennett’s ‘multiple drafts’
concept as a description of how verbal reports of internal states are produced, but as lacking in
any explanation of how consciousness is achieved (Dennett, 2007). He reminds us of Chalmers
comment that a theory of physics that does not explain consciousness is not a theory of
everything. Furthermore, he argues that ultimately our knowledge of objective science is only
available via our subjective conscious experience (Fig. 28).

Fig. 28 : Human consciousness as a template for a spectrum of common and transcendental experiences
(from King 2012).

He cautions against the common tendency to try and discount quantum uncertainty as
something that will be averaged out as a result of the very large number of quanta involved in
86

any macroscopic state. In Chaos theory, which may well have a role in brain processes, small
fluctuations may be inflated into important differences, and quantum uncertainties may be
included in these small differences. King goes on to look at the possible uses of quantum
computation. He mentions that classical computing has a problem with the potentially
unlimited time needed to check a range of possibilities
King favors the transactional interpretation of EPR type non-local quantum correlations. In the
transactional interpretation of non-local events, when a measurement is made on an entangled
particle, it sends a photon back in time to when it and the other entangled particle were
emitted, and then forward in time to the second entangled particle. Thus the net time taken to
send the quantum information about the measurement of the first particle is zero, and the
effect of measurement on the second particle appears to be instantaneous, despite the spatial
gap between them. The backward travel in time, which looks like an exotic feature is allowed
by the laws of physics as embodied in both the Maxwell and Schrodinger equations
King, 2014 thinks that the transactional interpretation of non-locality can be combined with

quantum computing to give a spacetime anticipating system and that this may be basic to the
way the brain works. He argues that the brain’s performance is not particularly impressive in
terms of what classical computers are good at, but it’s impressive in terms of anticipating
environmental and behavioral changes. Further citing this article: “The transactional
interpretation visualizes an exchanged particle wave function as the interference of a retarded
usual time direction offer wave and a time-reversed advanced confirmation wave. Time
symmetric interactions also occur in quantum field theories where special relativity allows
both advanced and retarded solutions because of the energy relation E = ± p2 + m2 . Virtual
photons and electron-positron pairs deflecting an electron in quantum electrodynamics. Since
the photon is its own anti-particle, a negative energy photon traveling backwards in time is
precisely a positive energy one traveling forwards. In quantum mechanics, not only are all
probability paths traced in the wave function, but past and future are interconnected in a timesymmetric hand-shaking relationship, so that the final states of a wave-particle or entangled
ensemble, on absorption, are boundary conditions for the interaction, just as the initial states
that created them are. The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics expresses this
relationship neatly in terms of offer waves from the past emitter/s and confirmation waves
from the future absorbers, whose wave interference becomes the single or entangled particles
passing between. When an entangled pair are created, each knows instantaneously the state of
the other and if one is found to be in a given state, e.g. of polarization or spin, the other is
immediately in the complementary state, no matter how far away it is in space-time. This is
the spooky action at a distance, which Einstein feared because it violates local Einsteinian
causality in which particles not communicating faster than the speed of light.

87

However quantum entanglement cannot be used to make classical causal predictions, which
would formally anticipate a future event, so the past-future handshaking lasts only as long as
a particle or entangled ensemble persist in their wave function. Weak quantum measurement
(WQM) is one way a form of quantum anticipation could arise. Weak quantum measurement
(Aharonov et al. 2010) is a process where a quantum wave function is not irreversibly
collapsed by absorbing the particle but a small deformation is made in the wave function
whose effects become apparent later when the particle is eventually absorbed e.g. on a
photographic plate in a strong quantum measurement. Weak quantum measurement changes
the wave function slightly mid-flight between emission and absorption, and hence before the
particle meets the future absorber involved in eventual detection . A small change is induced
in the wave function, e.g. by slightly altering its polarization along a given axis (Kocsis et al.
2011). This cannot be used to deduce the state of a given wave-particle at the time of
measurement because the wave function is only slightly perturbed, and is not collapsed or
absorbed, as in strong measurement, but one can build up a prediction statistically over many
repeated quanta of the conditions at the point of weak measurement, once post-selection data
is assembled after absorption.
This suggests (Merali, 2010, Cho, 2011) that, in some sense, the future is determining the
present, but in a way we can discover conclusively only by many repeats. Focus on any single
instance and you are left with an effect with no apparent cause, which one has to put it down
to a random experimental error. This has led some physicists to suggest that free-will exists
only in the freedom to choose not to make the post-selection(s) revealing the future฀s pull on
the present. Yakir Aharonov, the co-discoverer of weak quantum measurement (Aharonov et
al. 2010) sees this occurring through an advanced wave travelling backwards in time from the
future absorbing states to the time of weak measurement. What God gains by playing dice
with the universe, in Einstein’s words, in the quantum fuzziness of uncertainty, is just what is
needed, so that the future can exert an effect on the present, without ever being caught in the
act of doing it in any particular instance: .“The future can only affect the present if there is
room to write its influence off as a mistake.”, neatly explaining why no subjective account of
prescience can do so either. Weak quantum measurements have been used to elucidate the
trajectories of the wave function during its passage through a two-slit interference apparatus
Kocsis et al. 2011), to determine all aspects of the complex waveform of the wave function
(Hosten 2011, Lunden et al. 2011), to make ultra sensitive measurements of small deflections
(Hosten & Kwiat 2008, Dixon et al. 2008) and to demonstrate counterfactual results involving
both negative and positive post-selection probabilities, which still add up to certainty, when
two interference pathways overlap in a way which could result in annihilation (Lundeen &
Steinberg 2009). WQM provides a potential way that the brain might use its brain waves and
phase coherence to evoke entangled (coherent) states that carry quantum encrypted
information about immediate future states of experience as well as immediately past states, in
an expanded envelope - the quantum present. It is this coordinated state that corresponds to
subjective experience of the present moment, encoded through the parallel feature envelope of
88

the cerebral cortex, including the areas associated with consciousness. Effectively the brain is a
massively parallel ensemble of wave excitations reverberating with one another, through
couplings of varying strength in which excitations are emitted, modulated and absorbed.
Interpreted in terms of quantum excitations, the ongoing conscious brain state could be a
reverberating system of massively parallel weak quantum measurements (MPWQMs) of its
ongoing state.
This could in principle give the conscious brain a capacity to anticipate immediate future
threats through the intuitive avenues of prescience, paranoia and foreboding. This suggests
that the reverberating ensemble of the quantum present could provide an intuitive form of
anticipation complementing computational predictions. This would require significant
differences from the post-selection paradigm of weak quantum measurement experiments,
which are designed to produce a classically confirmed result from an eventual statistical
distribution in the future. In the brain, consciousness being identified with the coherent
excitations and hence the entangled condition could reverse the implication of backwards
causality of advanced waves, with the future effectively informing the present of itself in
quantum encrypted form through the space-time expansion of the quantum present.
Discovering a molecular-biological basis for such an effect would pose an ultimate challenge
to experimental neuroscience. An indication of how quantum chaos might lead to complex
forms of quantum entanglement can be gleaned from an ingenious experiment forming a
quantum analogue of a kicked top using an ultra-cold cesium atom kicked by a laser pulse in a
magnetic field. It is shown that the classical dynamical space of the kicked top, showing
domains of order where there is periodic motion and complementary regions of chaos where
there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions. In the quantum system (middle pair), in the
ordered dynamic (left), the linear entropy of the system (bottom pair) is reduced and there is
no quantum entanglement between the orbital and nuclear spin of the atom. However in the
chaotic dynamic (right) there is no such dip, as the orbital and nuclear spins have become
entangled as a result of the chaotic perturbations of the quantum tops motion (Chaudhury et
al. 2009, Steck 2009). This shows that, rather than the suppression of classical chaos seen in
closed quantum systems (King, 2013), reverberating chaotic quantum systems can introduce
new entanglements.
The prevailing theory for loss of phase coherence and entanglement is decoherence caused by
the interaction of a wave-particle with other wave particles in the environmental milieu. The
coherence of the original entanglement becomes perturbed by other successive forms of
entanglement, which successively reduce the coherence exponentially over time in the manner
of an open system chaotic billiards. However in a closed universe, such as the global
excitations of a brain state, decoherence does not necessarily approach the classical limit, but
may retain encoded entangled information, just as the above example of the quantum kicked
top does in a simpler atomic system, which could be referenced by the brain in the same way
89

multiple hippocampal representations over time can, as an organism explores a changing
habitat. Intriguingly, continued weak quantum measurement, rather than provoking
decoherence tends to preserve entanglement because the ordered nature of the weak quantum
measurements reduces the disordered nature of the environment (Hosten 2011, Lundeen et al.
2011). Massively parallel weak quantum measurements in the brain might thus function to
maintain the ongoing entanglement.

Fig. 29: Cartoons of the fractal structure of the anatomy and function of the brain

He also stresses the complex structure of neurons which contrasts to the simplistic way in
which their interactions are sometimes modeled in neuroscience. It is suggested that ‘edge-ofchaos’ transition in and out of chaos could be involved in perception (Fig. 29). Studies of the
olfactory cortex show that there is chaotic excitation forming a wave that eventually settles
into a basin in the energy landscape. Sometimes this comprises a new basin, in which case this
is part of the learning process. The advantage of a chaotic system is its sensitivity to small
differences, allowing them to explore a wide range of possibilities, rather than quickly being
trapped in one possibility far from the global optimum. Chaotic activity leads to states where
the brain would be very finely balanced between different possibilities, and at this point it
might be sufficiently sensitive to be influenced by quantum uncertainty. It has been
demonstrated that a single ion channel can excite a hippocampal neuron, which can in turn
lead to global changes. The brain explores ongoing situations which have no deductive
solution, by evoking an edge-of-chaos state which, when it transitions out of chaos, results in
90

the a ha of insight learning. The same process remains sensitively tuned for anticipating any
signs of danger in the wild. This is pretty much how we do experience waking consciousness.
If this process involves sensitivity to quantum indeterminacy the coherent excitations would
be quantum entangled, invoking new forms of quantum computation. However, King argues
that for good adaptive reasons, the brain goes beyond the brute force of quantum computing, to
achieve intuitive decisions and creativity both of which involves subjective consciousness. These ideas

appear to be similar in spirit to the Penrose concept of non-computability. In general
computation seeks a single outcome while creative activity and some other behaviors, seeks
diversity. Chaotic excitability is suggested as one of the earliest features of eukaryote cells.
This would allow the single cell to get feedback from the environment, rather than becoming
stuck in a particular and unsatisfactory oscillation. The behavior of single cell organisms in
being able to navigate and behave adaptively in their environment is in any case a problem for
cognitive theory. The human brain also exhibits a fractal structure (See Fig. 29), that forms a
suitable platform for chaotic (non- linear ) reception and expression of neuronal activity. In his
recent brilliant review on the cosmology of consciousness King addresses the unfolding of
consciousness in the Universe (King, 2012).
King formulates several ultimate questions:
-Is there any intrinsic meaning to life, or is it we ourselves, as living beings, who express the
meaning by unfolding it in our creative lives as conscious participants?
-Is the world heading for an apocalyptic falling out and a triage of nature caused by a failure
to protect our generations’ own futures, or is the entire universe evolving towards a state of
ever-deepening realization and enlightenment?
-Is the fulfillment of life in the universe found in some future ultimate state of enlightenment,
or is it expressed eternally across space-time in the consciousness of all sentient beings who
will come to witness or have witnessed the ongoing existential condition, who together bring
about the historical evolution of the conscious universe?
Hence King turns to the other side of the coin. Is there some way in which the universe is
coming to fruition through an accumulating sense of our own immanent conscious
integration? The Noösphere, according to the thoughts of Vladimir Vernadsky, Édouard Le
Roy and Teilhard de Chardin, denotes the "sphere of human thought" in a succession of
phases of development of the Earth, after the geosphere and the biosphere. Just as the
emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human
cognition fundamentally transforms the biosphere. Teilhard argued the noösphere is growing
towards an even greater integration and unification, culminating in the Omega Point, which
he saw as the goal of history in an apex of thought/consciousness.
That said, King states that it is clear that decisions we make which seek to protect the long91

term diversity of life and to cherish and replenish it for the future generations lay the
groundwork for such an unfolding, as do the creative expressions we make of our engagement
together in music, art literature and science and social and natural justice, realizing the
compassionate existence together and celebrating it. Neither is it a limitation on ourselves that
this potential future is something we can merely glimpse but not fully understand, for already
as conscious beings we stand male and female in the archetype of cosmic consciousness to
witness the totality in our visions and contemplations, and despite the tragedy of life in the
mortal coil, and the implicit violence of nature and entropy, we have the wonder of a free
lunch in this magical world to love and beget offspring through the sexual mystery which
spawned us and to appreciate the sheer magic of coexistence. Neuroscientist Chris Koch
echoes this view “Throughout my quest to understand consciousness, I never lost my sense of
living in a magical universe. I do believe some deep and elemental organizing principle
created the universe and set it in motion for a purpose I cannot comprehend. … But I do
believe the laws of physics overwhelmingly favored the emergence of consciousness, and that
those laws will lead us to a more or less complete knowledge of it.”
We need to appreciate every moment and every act, good and bad, for its unique
preciousness, for life is all too short and transient and yet our consciousness stands inscrutable
in the eternal moment and there are so many of these moments in a lifetime, they literally are
enough to fill the entire history of the universe.

Piero Scaruffi: Consciousness as an intrinsic feature of matter

Piero Scaruffi, 2006, takes the view that the more we come to know about the brain, the less
easy it becomes to explain consciousness in terms of classical physics. This is the direct
opposite of the mainstream view according to which greater knowledge of the brain will
inevitably reveal an explanation that can be described in terms of classical physics.
Neurobiology is by implication criticized for being so dependent on Newtonian physics,
despite this being known to be limited in its correctness. Neurobiologists have remained
attached to classical physics, despite the fact that the objects and processes they are studying

92

have become smaller, and therefore closer to needing a quantum interpretation. A further
problem is that consciousness was from the beginning excluded from Newtonian theory.
Scaruffi’s provides an outline of the main theories of quantum consciousness. Quantum
models of consciousness date back to the 1920’s and the birth of quantum theory itself.
However, the earliest detailed model appears to have been produced by Evan Walker, 2000
already in 1970. This proposed that electrons could quantum tunnel between adjacent neurons
to produce a virtual nervous system that direct the synapse-based system. The idea finds
echoes in the later Penrose/Hameroff model, where Hameroff suggests that quantum states
can extend across macroscopic areas of the brain, as a result of quantum tunnelling at gap
junctions linking the dendrites of different neurons.
As mentioned above, the physicist, Herbert Fröhlich, 1989, suggested that a quantum
phenomenon called Bose-Einstein condensation could arise in biological matter. Living matter
comprises mainly water and biomolecules, both of which are electrical dipoles. It is suggested
that when such oscillators are maintained at a constant temperature, as they are in the thermal
non-equilibrium of biological tissue, condensates can arise. These may also encode
information and transmit signals. At a later date, the Penrose/Hameroff model also used
condensates, which in conjunction with quantum tunneling at gap junctions allowed quantum
states to extend over macroscopic areas of the brain. In 1989, Ian Marshall also suggested that
consciousness could arise from the excitation of condensates in the brain.
The philosopher, Michael Lockwood, 1989 approached quantum consciousness from a
different angle. He argued that special relativity meant that mental states must be physical
states. Mental states existed in time, and because space and time were part of the same thing,
mental states must also exist in space. He viewed consciousness as having the role that the
observer has in the orthodox Bohr view of quantum mechanics, but also because of his
argument from special relativity argument, they have to be part of the physical state of the
brain. Consciousness is put in the position of scanning the brain looking for sensations.
Scaruffi also discusses the position of Karl Pribram, 1991, who considers that brain processes
have many of the properties of holograms. Sensory perception is seen as electromagnetic
activation propagating through the brain. These sensory waves can interfere with memory
also propagating as a wave to produce a holographic structure. Perceptions can be analysed
into component frequencies, and therefore dealt with by Fourier analyse. Dirac’s least action
principle constrains the trajectories of these waves.
The ideas of the philosopher, David Chalmer’s are also discussed. Chalmers is critical of
mainstream consciousness thinking, but does not see the solution in quantum theories of
consciousness. Chalmers, 2000 makes a distinction between the phenomenal concept of mind
93

(the way it feels) and the psychological concept (what the mind does). Every mental property
is considered to be either phenomenal or psychological or some combination of the two. Pain,
often viewed as an example of the qualia, is experienced subjectively, but can also be analysed
functionally. Chalmer’s proposed solution to the problem of consciousness is based on the
concept of information. Information is seen as the link between the physical and the conscious.
Information is pattern seen from the inside, and consciousness is seen as information about the
pattern of the self.
A Darwinist theory of consciousness
Scaruffi’s seeks to develop his own view on the subject of consciousness. He rejects the notion
that sensations or subjective experience can be reduced to particles. He suggests that we
should analyze why consciousness is limited to the brain, or in another words, what is special
about the brain that can’t be found elsewhere. The brain is described as being made by
common and well-known constituents of matter, with no explanation as to why they produce
consciousness, when configured as a brain, but not when configured as a foot. He does not
think that any account of the brain, however detailed it may become, will ever be able to
explain how the material components of the brain turn into consciousness.
Instead, consciousness itself must be an intrinsic physical property (Scaruffi, 2001), rather than
something that is created by other physical components. He compares those neuroscientists
who do not accept this, to a scientist that did not accept that electrical charge is a fundamental
property, but tried to explain it in terms of some other property such as gravity. He takes the
view that any paradigm that tries to manufacture consciousness out of something else is
doomed to failure. In such a paradigm, consciousness will seem to appear by magic by putting
neurons or similar components which have no sign of consciousness in their make up
together. He says that his theory is neither dualist nor reductionist. Consciousness is seen as
separate from physical science as described, but still a physical property. This approach seems
close to a physical defined panpsychism.

Danko Georgiev: The Quantum Neuron

Georgiev, 2003 is one of the few researchers actively investigating consciousness on the basis
of quantum activity in neurons. He disagrees with Hameroff’s model in a number of respects,
including the function of gap junctions relative to the binding of consciousness and instead
proposes a mechanism based on quantum brain dynamics, as developed by Jibu and Yasue
and alsoVitiello. Georgiev suggests a direct fundamental experience/consciousness
manifested by quantum systems. Thus he thinks of the quantum events/collapses as
“decisions” done by the experiencing quantum system, not as “events producing
consciousness”. In this new view the OR event will be a “decision making”, not an “experience
creating” event. If consciousness is an irreducible phenomenon at the quantum level there is
no need for it to “emerge” from “subconsciousness” which is a pseudo-scientific Freudian
concept. In summary, he sees the quantum state as a mental state of experience. OR (collapse,
reduction, etc.) is making a “decision” or “choice” i.e. it is not providing access to experience,
the experience is necessary before the decision or choice is made.
In this model, quantum entanglement can unify consciousness, because it entangles quantum
states, and quantum states are mental states of experience. Entanglement/binding may be
extended from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of the next by a protein bridge formed
by neurexin-neuroligin. Georgiev sees this as a more effective way of connecting neurons than
the idea of gap junctions. The idea is based on studies of split-brain patients who had their
corpus callosum cut surgically in order to alleviate epilepsy. Such patients host not one, but
two minds, one mind per hemisphere, each mind being unaware of the other mind in the
opposite hemisphere. Because corpus callosum is built up of axons projecting from one of the
brain hemispheres to the other one, this necessarily implies that cognitive binding involves
axons, and cannot be done through gap junctions between dendrite.
For your knowledge: Curiously, aware of my work but not citing it, Hameroff speculated that
dendrites also project from one hemisphere to the other one, so that to connect with gap
junctions to dendrites in the opposite hemisphere. This is ridiculous, because dendrites are not
myelinated and the currents in dendrites are passive, that is they do not use extra energy and
decay 3 times approximately every half millimetre. For a distance of 20 centimetres, the
95

electric current will decay 340 = 1.2×1019 times i.e. effectively drop to zero. Axon’s function is to
propagate electric current without decay – for this axons use action potentials and huge
amounts of metabolic energy, also axons are myelinated to avoid the leakage of current out of
the axon. See Figure 4f, in the following open access article:
Hameroff S. The "conscious pilot" - dendritic synchrony moves through the brain to mediate
consciousness. Journal of Biological Physics 2010; 36 (1): 71-93.

Fig.28: An overview of the various modalities of synaptic transmission in brain

The development of molecular biology during the latter part of the 20th century made it clear
that neurons were highly complex, and from this it became apparent that features such as
memory and some diseases such as dementias might be better understood in terms of
molecular changes within the neurons. In these cases, it has been shown that not only are there
changes in neuronal firing, but also in cytoskeletal organization, the cytoskeleton being
composed of biomolecules that are the basis of life. The DNA of the cell nucleus contains
essential information, but is viewed here as being driven by the transfer of information from
the cytoskeleton.
In looking at the synapses between neurons (see Fig. 30), the author draws particular attention
to the metabotropic links, as distinct from the ionotropic links that take the form of electrical
signals via membrane ion channels. With the metabotropic links, neurotransmitters bind to Gprotein coupled receptors (GPCR). These activate second messengers, which in turn act on
protein kinases and phosphatises that modulate the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton in its turn
96

signals protein production requirements to the nucleus of the cell. The fast electrical activity of
the ion channels is contrasted with the slower biochemical processes within the neuron.
Georgiev says that the Hameroff model only takes account of the biochemical and not the
electrical activity. He disagrees with this exclusion of electrical activity, pointing out that
Penfield’s ground breaking research in the mid 20th century showed that conscious memories
could be evoked by inserting electrodes into parts of the cortex.
Georgiev argues that in neurons, the electric field is not confined to the ion channels in the
membrane, which is the conventional view, but that it can also act directly on the
microtubules. This concept is in line with ideas put forward by Jibu and Yasue, 1992, 1993 and
also by Vitiello 1995, 2001. The approach of these researchers involves a quantum field theory
of the electric dipoles of water molecules in the brain, and here, particularly within the
neurons. The dipole rotational symmetry of the water molecules is proposed to break into the
quanta of dipole vibrational waves or dipole wave quanta (dwq), which manifest as longrange correlations in water. As such, they transmit information in water.
These correlations are suggested by Georgiev to influence the conformation of the microtubule
tubulin ‘tails’ that protrude from microtubules. The coherent behavior of the tubulin tails can
be modeled as solitary waves (solitons) propagating along the outer surface of the
microtubules, and acting as a dissipationless mechanism for the transmission of information
along the microtubule. Collisions of the waves formed by the tubulin tails are suggested to act
as a computational gate for the control of cytoskeletal processes. It is already experimentally
verified that tubulin activity controls the sites where microtubule associated proteins (MAPs)
attach to microtubules, and also controls the transport of vesicles of neurotransmitters towards
synapses. The output of the computation performed by the tubulin tails is here suggested to
come via the MAP attachments and also the kinesin motor transport along the microtubules.

that enables the release of chemical messengers: the neurotransmitters. Fine structure of microfilaments and tubules is indicated.

The author goes on to discuss the probabilistic nature of neurotransmitter release at the
synapses, and the possible connection this has with quantum activity in the brain. The
probability of the synapse firing in response to an electrical signal is estimated at only around
25%. Georgiev points out that an axon forms synapses with hundreds of other neurons, and
that if the firing of all these synapses was random, the operation of the brain could prove
chaotic. He suggests instead the choice of which synapses will fire is connected to
consciousness, and that consciousness acts within neurons, an idea that dates back to Sir John
Eccles. In a later amendment of Eccles idea and in collaboration with James Glazebrook,
Georgiev is now suggesting that quantum tunnelling with SNARE (an acronym derived from
"SNAP (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) REceptor") proteins could control the release of
neurotransmitters from vesicles in the synapse.

Glazebrook Biomedical Reviews 2010; 21: 17-23 :: http://dx.doi.org/10.14748/bmr.v21.43

The structure of the grid in which the vesicles are held is claimed to be suitable to support
vibrationally assisted quantum tunneling. Georgiev also thinks that B-neurexin and
neuroligin-1 proteins that form a bridge between the axonal and dendritic cytoskeletons are
relevant to consciousness. Georgiev also discusses Max Tegmark’s paper, 2000, which
conventional consciousness study thinking views as having completely dismissed the
possibility of consciousness based on quantum coherence in the brain. In respect of this
debate, Georgiev points out that the real question is whether the time to decoherence is greater
or lesser than the timescale of dynamical changes in the brain. He agrees that if the
decoherence time is shorter than the dynamical time, it is not feasible for quantum coherence
to be involved in brain activity. In his 2000 paper, Tegmark has a decoherence time of 10^-13
seconds. It is suggested that neuronal activity is orchestrated via the conformational activity of
tubulin subunits (Fig.32), and that this activity has a dynamical timescale that could fall within
the Tegmark timescale. The conformational transition times within the tubular proteins of the
microtubules coincides with transition times for the microtubules as a whole. Georgiev’s
answer to Tegmark is also an answer to the main thrust of the Koch and Hepp (2006) paper
also purporting to dismiss quantum mind theories.

the fine structure of the tubulin protein lattice.

Georgiev’s work represents something of a hybrid theory mixing the quantum brain dynamics
model promoted in recent years by Jibu and Yasue and also Vitiello with the quantum
consciousness theory of Penrose and Hameroff, 2013. Georgiev thinks that the Hameroff
scheme for instantiating quantum consciousness in the brain is flawed in a number of respects,
and proposes a neuronal mechanism that is closer to quantum brain dynamics. Georgiev also
rejects Hameroff’s idea of quantum tunnelling at gap junctions between dendrites, citing a lack
of suitable structures for coherence in the dendritic spines where the junctions are located. In
Georgiev’s model, objective reductions occur so that choices can be made, with quantum states
of the brain providing a continuous stream of consciousness because the quantum state is
always present.

Andrei Khrennikov: Quantum like brain and metaphoric QM models

Khrennikov, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, regards quantum mechanics as a general
mathematical formalism for describing incomplete information about events. He suggests that
quantum-like (QL) processing occurs in the brain. He is at pains to stress that he does not see
this as related to actual quantum states in the brain, as is the case with most other theories of
quantum consciousness. QL processing is suggested to arise from the brain as described by
conventional neuroscience with neurons/synapses as the basic units. It is suggested that the
unconscious mind uses classical processing, while only the conscious mind runs on QL.
Unconscious information is projected into consciousness, where it is subject to QL processing.
In the manner of quantum mechanics, complex-number probability amplitudes constitute a
wave function, in this case a mental wave function, related to probability by the algorithms of
quantum mechanics. Consciousness is here claimed to operate with quantum algorithms that
are essentially different from those used by existing (classical) computers. In the case of the
brain, this theory suggests that the quantum algorithms can be used without involving actual
quantum states, but instead spring from the already known biological processes that are
themselves described by classical physics. The system is seen as being based on and created by
the parallel workings of billions of neurons, with a QL facility much faster than any classical
computer. Khrennikov also thinks the neural processing depends on two distinct timescales, a
fine grained timescale for classical processing, and a less exact timescale of possibly about 100
ms produced by quantum averaging. He discusses some recent studies that he considers
supportive of this suggestion.
The author argues that there is nothing surprising about algorithms derived from quantum
mechanics being implemented on biological processes that can themselves be understood in a
strictly classical way. He points out that differential calculus was developed to serve
Newtonian mechanics, but proved useful for other areas of physics. I am not sure that this
argument is completely convincing. The common feature of the theories for which calculus
was useful is that they described the movement of matter and energy in space and time,
without the acausal disjuncture involved in the randomness of the quantum wave function
collapse. In the case of Khrennikov’s theory, we are asked to accept the application of a system
which does involve an acausal disjuncture to resolve the processing of a biological system that
101

is deemed to be classical. The two systems, at first sight, appear much more dissimilar than the
various classical theories for which calculus is useful.
Khrennikov argues that his QL scheme does not suffer from the difficulty of explaining how
quantum states could persist in the brain for a length of time likely to be relevant to neural
processing. This has long been the most cogent argument against theories of quantum
consciousness. However, in common with more conventional researchers, Krennikov’s
discussion of quantum theories of consciousness appears skimpy. He mentions in passing the
problem of likely rapid quantum decoherence in the conditions of the brain, without
discussing the possibility of quantum features being shielded, which is an important aspect of
some quantum consciousness theories. He says that it is hard not to view the neurons as the
basic units of neural processing, and suggests that quantum consciousness more-or-less
ignores the processing of neurons. However, this is not always the case. The
Penrose/Hameroff theory involves an interactive exchange between microtubular processing
and synapses, while with Bernroider’s ion channel theory the quantum processes drive the ion
channels, which in turn constitute a fundamental element within the conventional neuron
theory.
Khrennikov is more convincing when he discusses the advantages of QL. If an organism does
not have access to complete information, or does not have time to classically process the
information that it possesses, QL can create a model based on partial information. He argues
that in classical processing the brain would need to perform integration over space having the
dimension of a few billions. From this, he argues that in an advanced brain simple acts of
cognition would take an impossibly long time. Similar arguments have been advanced by
other researchers on perception, who argue that while bottom up calculations do not yield a
unique solution, bottom down calculations take an impractically long time.
The real problem with this theory, as with all classical approaches and quite a few quantum
approaches to consciousness, is that while it is insightful, at the end of the day it seems to lack
explanatory power as regards the essential subjective experience of consciousness. If quantum
algorithms did arise from a classical biological strata, in order to deal with the perception
problems of the brain, there is no apparent reason why such quantum processing should not
be achieved unconsciously, as is quantum processing in physics outside the brain. Quantum
consciousness theories appear to have no special advantage over classical theories, unless they
can appeal to some special function at the fundamental level of energy or possibly spacetime
that is possibly capable of acting as the source of consciousness.
Other related metaphoric models
With regard to quantum models a distinction is made between QM models in which
intentional conscious acts are correlated with physical state reductions including QM field
102

models in which mental states are treated as vacuum states of quantum fields as opposed to
QM metaphoric models (see Meijer and Korf, 2013), who stated the following:
“With regard to the latter, Niels Bohr has already suggested that mutually excluding images
(see below) have aided the formulation of the complementary hypothesis of quantum
mechanics (Busemeyer and Bruza 2012). Many authors (references in Atmanspacher, 2007,
2004; Busemeyer and Bruza 2012), have recognized the potential of using a quantum
probability approach in the psychology of cognition and decision making rather than more
classical approaches. Quantum mechanics and its formalisms should be viewed upon here as a
metaphors, Atmanspacher et al. (2004), in that “particular features of the quantum theoretical
formalism are realized in a non-physical context”.
Recent research has been focused on modeling of decision making (Busemeyer and Bruza,
2012; Pothos and Busemeyer, 2011). In experimental settings subjects were asked to make easy
choices with game cards between a few alternatives. These alternatives were best described
with stochastic models, rather than as deterministic processes. Other research did focus on the
idea of geometric sub-spaces, where the probability of choices became order- and contextdependent. This means that decisions are made not only by taking into account the grounds as
independently contributing factors, but also by their order of exposure to the subject. Again,
this has been related to the “real” quantum theory, where a wave function (in a superposition
and without a distinct spatial location) becomes a well-localized particle after interference
with a physical body, including an observer.
The authors of the latter studies emphasized the quantum nature of their models, because they
use terms such as superposition, entanglement and collapse as they are used in quantum
physics to denote an undetermined state (a wave function), that after collapse behaves as a
particle. Entanglement is used in QM to denote that, for instance, spin properties of a particle
(entities) are correlated with a related particle, in the sense that. the orientation of the spin of
one particle becomes determined after the collapse through observation of the related particle.
Related to these QM ideas are rapidly alternating brain and mind states as, for example,
illustrated with classical ambiguity pictures, picturing the brain in a state of superposition
(Atmanspacher et al., 2004), see also Fig.33.

103

Fig. 31: Metaphoric representations of quantum consciousness
A quantum approach was also used to model bi-stable perceptions: figures such as the Necker
cube, can be interpreted as either of the particular spatial configurations. The switch between
these interpretations are assumed to be short as compared to observation time (“Zeno effect”,
see Schwartz et al., 2004; Stapp, 2009, 2012), and, moreover, the two interpretations are
mutually exclusive: the interwoven objects cannot simultaneously be conceptualized. During a
short period of time only one configuration is recognized and alternating views are more or
less subject to the will of the observer. Despite such persuading theorizing, Busemeyer and
Bruza (2012) lay to heart the lesson that in the psychological experiment a superposition is
merely a word that can be interpreted as representing a number of different senses, while an
entangled cognitive state is highly biased towards one subset of interpretive senses. Finally,
collapse is merely the process “by which a subject decides upon a particular interpretation in
the context of a set of cues and stimuli.“ The question remains how and when such
subconscious thoughts or arguments become manifest prior to the very moment that the
subject definitely chooses or decides.
The related time course of the cerebral electrophysiological activity was described during the
initiation and execution of voluntarily behavior (e.g. movement of the fingers) by the classical
experiments of Libet and later by others. This approach (Libet 2006; Haggard 2005; Soon et al.,
2008; Bode et al., 2011) might be regarded as a decision making experiment and the readiness

potential can be seen as to reflect the superposition state of the brain. Following regional brain
activity using fMRI technology (see Bode et al., 2011) showed that the preparation phase in the
anterior frontopolar cortex might precede the decision as much as 6 seconds. Once in the
superposition state, decisions in a laboratory context are made in a very short period of time
(already within 50 milliseconds; as in the Turennout, 1998 study) as compared to the
preparation time.
Spivey and coworkers, 2007, have emphasized the continuity of mind, rather than sequential
states, as opposed to the quantum approach. They illustrate their ideas with decision-making
experiments, showing that the subjects in an, apparently indecisive, state, stay longer
indecisive when the decisions are more ambivalent, once the choice as been made, the decision
is realized faster (Pezzulo et al., 2011; Spivey 2007). These studies show that decisions are
anticipated far before the overt behavior (Bode et al., 2011). These laboratory experiments are
compatible with the idea that the central nervous system (the subject) develops a kind of
superposition state before making the choice (the “collapse”). For the subject, the significance
of artificial problem solving, is evidently modest and requires little “mind-space.” More
important decisions might require a “larger space of the personal universe”, and more
processing time.
Trueblood and Busemeyer (2012) summarize four reasons for considering a quantum
approach to human judgments: (1) human judgment is not a simple readout from pre-existing
or recorded state, it is rather the process of imposing measurements that forces the resolution
of the indeterminacy; (2) before measurement cognition behaves more like a wave than a
particle allowing the individual to feel a sense of ambiguity about different belief states
simultaneously, as if beliefs remain in a superimposed state until a final decision must be
reached; (3) changes in the context produced by one judgment can affect later judgments:
quantum probability theory captures this phenomenon through the notion of incompatibility
about another; (4) cognitive logic does not necessarily obey the rules of classic logic such as the
commutative and distributive axioms. Quantum logic is more generalized than classic logic
and can model human judgments that do not obey Boolean logic”.

Hu and Wu/ Persinger: Spin- mediated consciousness

Maoxin Wu

Huping Hu

Michael Persinger

This recent theory of quantum consciousness relates to work by the physicists, Hu, and Wu,
2004, 2010 carried out within the last ten years. Harking back to Penrose’s concept of a spin
network, the quantum property of spin is seen as being embedded in the structure and shape
of spacetime. Quantum entanglement is seen as deriving from spin, presumably because spin
and polarisation are the properties that can be altered by entanglement. Spin is also seen as
primordial, pre-dating in the early universe the emergence of matter that involves mass and
charge. With respect to consciousness theory, spins are regarded as the ‘pixels’ of
consciousness(Fig. 27). This is therefore a fundamental theory of consciousness. Consciousness
is not arbitrarily related either to some classical feature or some particular quanta, but
indicated as a given property of the universe that cannot be explained in terms of other
physics or biology, and is also related to conditions that are only known to arise in the brain.
In relation to spin, the authors envisage a number of processes in the brain. They start with
action potentials, which are suggested to indirectly modulate networks of nuclear spins via the
electrons associated with the nuclei. The authors studies are claimed to support this idea via
three indicators, being photon emissions, EEG activity and alterations in the immediate
geomagnetic field. Further to this, a reduction in the local geomagnetic field running from the
rear to the front of the cortex is related to neural rhythms and in particular the gamma
synchrony, running in the opposite direction to the geomagnetic gradient. This presumably
allows the inter-connection of conscious spin activities in different parts of the brain. The rest
of this review deals mainly with studies that claim to support the above proposals.
In one study (Hu & Wu, 2004), it was proposed that networks of nuclear spins in neural
membranes are associated with strongly fluctuating magnetic fields that are modulated by the
indirect dipole-to-dipole coupling in action potentials. Interactions between two nuclear spins
result indirectly from the interactions of electrons around the nuclei. Hu and Wu found that
these couplings had frequencies of 5-25 Hz, which are within the EEG range of activity. They
predicted that magnetic fields associated with spin-related coupling across the cell membrane
would have an energy value equivalent to photon emission (Fig.34).
106

Fig. 34: The plasma membrane structure and membrane potential of neurons exhibiting channel
proteins that enable electric activity through trans-membrane flux of Na- an K-ions, that may be
influenced by quantum spin information of the constituting elementary particles of channel proteins.

It is proposed by Persinger et al, 2013 that the underlying spin networks could be linked to
photon emissions observed with particular brain activities. The energies available to the
neuronal membrane are suggested to be within the range associated with photon emission,
and therefore capabable of interacting with it, or altering it. A recent study by one of the
authors showed that photon emissions from cell cultures were mainly emitted from cell
membranes. Another study showed that photon emissions in brain tissue varied strongly,
when the tissue was either oxygen deprived, or alternatively exposed to pure oxygen. In
further studies involving the authors, subjects thought about either bright white light or else
random experiences. It was found that the intensity of emissions from the right hemisphere of
the brain were correlated with EEG activity over the left prefrontal, when the subjects were
imagining white light, but not at other times. In another study, photon emissions while the
subject was imagining white light had a pronounced inverse correlation with the intensity of
the horizontal geomagnetic field.
A further study of Dotta and Persinger, 2011 looked at the behavior of the parahippocampal
gyri in both hemispheres, when the subject was and alternatively was not thinking about light.
When light was imagined by the subject, there was a marked increase in power in the delta,
107

beta and gamma bands associated with activation of the parahippocampal gyrei. Photon
emissions were elevated in the 16-17 Hz range, while the subject imagined light, and this
corresponds to the range of proton couplings predicted by Hu and Wu, 2004
One pattern revealed in these studies was the change in geomagnetic intensity between the
rear and front of the cortex, while the subject was experiencing white light, something which
was much less marked in the absence of thinking about light. A decrease in geomagnetic
intensity was associated with increased photon emission in the cortex. The decrease was
consistent with Wu an Hu’s prediction for proton-proton spin interactions over the cell
membrane. The authors suggest that both the energy increase from photon emissions and the
energy decrease in the geomagnetic field derive from the same source. The energy associated
with changes in the geomagnetic field was of the same order as the energy associated with
photon emissions.
The authors (Dotta et al, 2012) argue that the state of consciousness associated with imagining
white light relates to changes in the intensity of the geomagnetic field within the brain. Photon
emissions were also related to the strength of activity within the beta and gamma wave
ranges, where the gamma synchrony is the best known correlate of consciousness. The change
in the geomagnetic intensity is within Hu and Wu’s predicted range for proton-proton
interactions.
The change in the geomagnetic field occurred in a specific direction from the back to the front
of the brain, and the authors relate this to a movement in the opposite direction by gamma and
other electromagnetic waves. It is suggested that gamma and other oscillations interact with
the geomagnetic field to emit photons. This could be expected to be represented within photon
fields associated with action potentials. The suggestion is that photon emissions, geomagnetic
intensity and the gamma and other oscillations in the brain are interrelated. These
geomagnetic studies are argues to support Hu and Wu’s hypothesis of nuclear spin-pin
interactions in response to action potentials that could relate to wider neural activity,
consciousness and spacetime patterns of spin.
Hu and Wu (2004 and 2010), suggested a spin mediated theory of consciousness with the
quantum spin as the seat of consciousness. The spins provide an interface between the
composition of the brain and the electromagnetic waves that cross the brain. Consciousness is
seen as emerging from the collapse of spin states that are entangled with one another.

Chris Clarke: Qualia and free will

Chris JS Clarke, 1995, 2000, 2001 discusses qualia and free will. Clarke defines the irreducible
aspect of qualia and also free will as the essence of human consciousness. He thinks that qualia
arise from an ‘entanglement’ between a person and the perceived object. Free will is suggested
to arise from the use of self-reflection to change the reference frame within which decisions are
taken. This change in the reference frame is likened to the change between quantum wave and
particle. Clarke does not think that these characteristics can be derived by just summing up the
microscopic events found in quantum theory.
In discussing qualia, Clarke remarks that consciousness is a unity and some aspects of this are
qualia such as colour. However, the totality of consciousness is more than just the total of
various qualia. Clarke takes the view that in looking at, for instance a tree, we perceive a
variety of qualia, but that there is no tree quale. Clarke also distinguishes between internal
experience, such as anger etc, and the perception of external objects. Clarke argues, in line
with Heidegger, that the primal qualia is the internal experience, with infants gradually
learning to split off the perceived external world from their internal experience. The last has
been confirmed by studies of child development.
The present scientific orthodoxy is seen as going only half way to describe qualia. The
perceptual world and its qualia are seen as only a model of external reality. There are one-toone correspondences between external things and perceptions, but they are not at all the same
thing. Thus a particular frequency of oscillation of photons corresponds to the quale of the
colour red, but in contrast to the external behaviour of the photon, the physical nature of the
redness quale is completely unknown, and it is not apparent how it would be discovered by a
conventional scientific approach.
Clarke, in line with Max Velman wants to stand the traditional scientific view on its head.
Instead of our perceptions being a model of external reality, external reality is modelled by our
perceptions, with the qualia being out there in the external world, and apparently being the
product of entanglement between the two systems.

109

Fig. 35: Mental participation implies bifurcation of individual life lines and free choice

In discussing free will, Clarke looks at our process of decision taking where we envisage the
possible outcome of actions and evaluate our emotional response to these. This approach is
often effective in reaching a decision, but on some occasions we are still left without a decision.
Clarke suggests that free will or something like it cuts in at this point, and changes the frame
of reference so that we might suddenly bring in the thought, what would X have done or
thought in this situation, thus moving the decision making process into a new frame of
reference. (Fig. 35)
Chris Clarke claims that the stories that society tells itself about the physical nature of the
world really matter because this affects the values of the society, and reinforces or undermines
its power structures. The current mainstream paradigm derives from Newton, with
subsequent additions from 19th century physics and 20th century molecular biology, and is
now entrenched in the modern educational and medical systems. In earlier centuries, western
thinking was dualistic. Clarke traces this back to ancient Greek philosophy, with humans
comprised of two distinct substances, body and spirit. This idea was inherited by Christianity,
and then given a more definite form by Descartes in the 17th century.
In the subsequent centuries, there was a gradual squeezing out of the spirit from this initially
dualist view. This resulted from the ability of science to give a physical explanation to more
and more things that had previously seemed to be the role of the spirit. The invention of
computers, as a form of mechanical brain, seemed to round off this world view. The world is
110

viewed as a system of isolated atoms and ideas such as meaning and purpose are deemed to
be an illusion. At the same time, physics seems to leave out consciousness and the possibly
related concepts of meaning and creativity. Further, the mainstream idea of phenomena,
referring to mental experience appears to presuppose the idea of perceptions being mere
mental appearances produced by an external reality.
Clarke is particularly critical of the current mainstream approach to consciousness. He
criticizes writers who replace the basic experience of the subjective with something at once
more restricted and more complicated, such as self-consciousness, reasoning or problem
solving. These writers appear not to notice the basic substratum of the subjective, thus
rendering most of their discussion irrelevant.
Dennett, 2007, who is pre-eminent amongst mainstream thinkers on consciousness and taken
as sole guide by some popular writers, is particularly criticized for looking at the problem
from only a third person point of view, when the very concept of the third person assumes the
existence of the first person.
Newtonian physics had in principle the ability to specify the position and velocity of every
particle in the universe, and all properties of the universe could be specified in these terms.
However, this approach is undermined by quantum mechanics. With respect to quantum
mechanics, Clarke stresses two concepts, complementarity and non-locality.
Complimentarity does not allow us to specify all the properties of a physical system.
Observation by an observer on the macroscopic world can determine which properties of a
quantum system can be given values such as position or momentum. Clarke interprets this to
mean that reality does not run from the quantum to the macroscopic, but constitutes an
interplay between the two. This is related to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, where two
values such as position and momentum cannot be specified at the same time, but only two
approximations, with the product of these uncertainties being equal to or greater than Planck’s
constant. Clarke also argues that the majority of physicists who ignore quantum effects at the
macroscopic or classical level are wrong, because with something like a living organism that
has intermeshed interactions at many different scales, quantum unpredictability could
manifest at the macroscopic level.
Clarke further discusses the problem of non-locality. A field, such as the electromagnetic field
is regarded as local. At each point in spacetime the field takes a particular value. The field
changes in time as a result of the value of the field at neighbouring points and never as a
function of the values of distant points.
However, quantum states can be non-local. The Alain Aspect, 1982 experiment showed that
there could be a correlation between distant quantum particles that could not be a function of
111

any of the particles that were local to the particles concerned. This suggests to Clarke that the
particles are integrated into a larger system by underlying non-local connections. There is no
possibility of communication between these particles, and this hard to explain characteristic
leads Clarke to claim that existing physics, including quantum mechanics, is incomplete.
Clarke puts interpretations of quantum mechanics into two groups. Firstly, there are those that
envisage the collapse of the wave function as a real physical event, while in the other camp
views such as the Copenhagen interpretation regard the quantum states as mere abstractions
necessary to predict and understand the outcome of experiments.
Clarke builds on the latter approach at the same time as saying that physics needs to be
extended in order to provide a complete theory. First, he proposes a version known as
histories of interpretation of quantum theory. Here the basic fact about a quantum state is the
history that created the particular state, and a calculation of a probability of any particular
history. An admitted problem here is the vast number of possible histories that could account
for a state. There has to be a way of paring these down, and consciousness is suggested as the
way of doing this.
Clarke describes the conscious ‘I’ as on the one hand linked with the various subsystems of the
body but on the other hand, through quantum locality, including within it aspects of the
people and things that it perceives. This represents a distinct view of quantum consciousness
based mainly on non-locality.
It is disappointing that Clarke does not at least speculate on the practicalities of his proposal.
For instance, non-locality does not allow the transmission of matter or energy, or of normal
information, which is instantiated in matter or energy, but only of quantum properties, such as
the spin of a particle. This leads on to Clarke’s take with respect to free will, where his stance is
somewhat confusing. In the first place, he suggests that decisions are based on a mixture of
deterministic problem solving and randomness, the latter presumably quantum related.
However, the mind is allowed to move into new frameworks of meaning, when consciousness
changes the way in which it selects from different quantum histories. It is not really clear what
triggers these changes of framework or how important they are in the overall workings of the
mind, nor why it is the selection of histories rather than futures that is important. Altogether,
Clarke puts forward an interesting concept, but one that needs much more development.

112

Herms Romijn: Photon- mediated consciousness

Romijn, 1997 puts forward the concept that subjectivity or consciousness is coded into the
virtual photons that generate electric and magnetic fields. This approach has considerable
advantages. Photons intermediating the electromagnetic force are, as far as we know, the most
basic level of the universe. At this level the fundamental components of the universe have
given properties that cannot be explained, analysed or reduced further. So both the charge on
the electron and the ability of the photon to intermediate it across space are given properties
that cannot be explained or reduced. This is the only physical level at which it is possible to
have properties that cannot be reduced to something more fundamental.
The article suggests that photons carry subjectivity or consciousness as such a given property.
This is in principle possible because irreducible properties are present at this level. It is more
reasonable than the mainstream approach, which suggests that a new property of
consciousness can be produced by banging together previously unconscious bits of matter.
The problem would be the same if we tried to say that electrical charge was a function of
banging things together in some complex system. It might look plausible, but we would
forever be looking for what actually happened that produced the charge. Romijn’s theory is
not fully panpsychic. Although subjectivity is present at the level of photons, it requires brain
sytems to generate ordered patterns that are the basis of actual conscious experience.
Romijn views the brain as a chaotic self-organising process, the outcome of which is the
pattern of electric and magnetic fields generated by the dendritic trees of neurons. The author
thinks that these patterns code for the qualia. Virtual photons comprise the electric and
magnetic fields and it is these which are claimed to encode conscious experience. Romijn
argues that they are causally necessary and sufficient for consciousness. Romijn takes an
initially conventional approach in pointing out that brain scan studies show a correlation
between neural activity and subjective experiences (Raichle, 1998; Schacter et al, 1998).
Romijn takes the view that subjective experience is as real for the experiencer as brain scan
activity is for the third party investigator.

and a schematic representation of the left and right hemispheres of the brain supposed to bear different
functions

The Role of Dendrites
Romijn discusses the detailed behaviour of dendrites. When a dendrite receives a signal from
another neuron there is a depolarisation of the membrane, in the case of an excitatory signal,
and hyperpolarisation in the event of an inhibitory signal. This creates an electric field
between the the part of the dendrite membrane that has become polarised or hyperpolarised
and the rest of the membrane. The greater part of the electric field will flow towards the cell
body and the axon hillock because the dendrite is thicker in that direction. This action along
the dendrite also generates a magnetic field (Fig.36).
The dendritic tree has been shown to use several different forms of information processing. At
the synapse the incoming pattern of action potentials determines which of various
neurotransmitters stored there are released. On the dendritic side, receptors are sensitive to
particular neurotransmitters. The receptors are clustered in complex spatial patterns.
Receptors can modulate each other performance. Outside the synaptic cleft, the extracellular
fluid has a low concentration of ions, neurotransmitters and hormones that may exert a
synchronising effect between neurons. Studies have shown that the dendritic tree can detect
the individual discharge of synapses and has mechanisms for amplifying the signal to noise
ratio. Dendritic spines provide the postsynaptic contact sites for 80% of excitatory synapses.
114

Spines can change their shape in a period of milliseconds, which changes the flow of
information into the dendrites.
Protein molecules constitute ion channels, receptors and enzymes and have electrically
charged groups held together by van der Waals forces. These electrostatic binding forces
determine the tertiary structure of proteins, and thence some of their properties. The ions,
receptors and enzymes experience fluctuations as a result of the electrical field around the
dendrite (Fröhlich, 1975, Goodman et al, 1995). It has been shown that postsynaptic receptor
and ion distribution continually undergoes non-linear changes because of the synaptic electric
fields. All this means that the dendritic tree has the ability to tune itself to the inflow of
information, which in turn results in ordered electric and magnetic fields.
Romijn points out that synaptic transmissions are probabilistic. When an action potential
reaches a synapse, there is no certainty that the synapse will fire. There is only a probability, of
between 30% and 80%, depending on the type of synapse, that it will fire. In some studies
(Lehman et al, 1998; Zeki & Bartels, 1998) , field configurations, which had to remain stable in
the cortex for a minimal time such as 120ms were related to various types of mental activity.
Shorter lived fields are thought to relate to the unconscious level. The electrical and magnetic
fields are seen as having a vast number of possible semi-stable configurations they can take up
in response to either external stimuli or existing memories (Sakai & Miyashita, 1994) and
Tononi et al, 2008). These fields formed out of virtual photons, the intermediating
particle/waves of the electromagnetic force, are deemed to be the carriers of consciousness in
the brain.

115

More recent developments in photon-mediated consciousness hypothesis
Recent experiments confirm Romijn’s ideas in the sense that a biophoton coherent system may
constitute an ultra rapid communication system not only in the brain but also functioning in
the whole organism, explaining the amazing concerted actions of complex living organisms.
Regarding the biophysical visual representation idea, it should be stressed that the phrase
“ultraweak biophoton emission” is confusing, as it suggests that ultraweak biophotons are not
important in cellular mechanisms but are by-products of free radical reactions. In contrasts
externally measured ultraweak biophoton emission from cells and neurons is principally
produced from natural oxidation processes on the surfaces of cellular membranes as
demonstrated by Blake et al. 2011, Fig 37). However, the real biophoton intensity, as produced
in mitochondria (see Fig. 30), as well as DNA/RNA, can be fundamentally higher inside cells
and neurons (Bókkon et al., 2010) compared with the biophoton intensity in their surrounding
environment which makes it possible for the emergence of intrinsic biophysical pictures in V1
visual areas (Fig. 38 ).
Long-term visual memories may not stored as biophysical pictures but as redox regulated
epigenetic codes. During visual imagery, top-down processes trigger and regulate the
epigenetic encoded long-term visual information. Next, according to retrieved neural
epigenetic information, mitochondrial networks in synchronized neurons generate patterns of
biophotons through redox reactions, which can produce intrinsic biophysical pictures in
retinotopic and mitochondrial rich visual neurons during visual imagery, REMS associated
dreams or visual hallucination (Bókkon, 2009; Bókkon and D'Angiulli, 2009; Bókkon et al.,
2010a). First biophoton experiments may support our biophysical pictures representation.
Namely, Dotta and Persinger, (2011) and Dotta et al. (2012) observed cognitive coupling with
biophoton emission in the brain during subjective visual imagery (Fig. 31). In addition, the
biophoton emissions were strongly correlated with EEG activity and the emergence of action
potentials in axons. In addition, Sun et al., (2010), revealed that biophotons can conduct along
the neural fibers which supports this biophysical picture hypothesis. It appears that
biophotonic and bioelectronic activities are not independent biological processes in the
nervous system, and their synergistic action may play a significant role in neural signal
processes

Stuart Kauffman: Consciousness & the Poised State

In the final stage of his book Reinventing the Sacred, Kauffman, 2008, argues that
consciousness derives from a ‘poised state’ between quantum coherence and decoherence into
classical states. He looks to the transition from a quantum world of persisting possibilities to a
classical world of actual possibilities. The acausal nature of quantum mechanics is central to
his thinking. The Schrödinger equation is solved for the amplitude of the electron at each point
in space. These eigenfunctions square the amplitude at each point in space, and define the
117

probability of finding an electron at each point in space. Nothing known causes the electron’s
choice of position, there are only probabilities at every point in space. For Kauffman, quantum
mechanics breaks out of the causal closure of the reductionistic tradition. Amongst other
things he suggests that this might resolve the problem of freewill, which cannot exist within
deterministic physics.
Kauffman discusses the concept of phase information. The interference pattern seen in the
two-slit experiment requires all the phase information on the final screen to add together to
give the peaks and troughs of the interference pattern. Decoherence involves the loss of phase
information as a result of interaction with the environment, often described as a heat bath of
quantum oscillators. The interaction with the environment in seen as comparable to the
interaction with the measuring device in the Copenhagen interpretation. However
decoherence may not be as clear cut as the Copenhagen type measurement. In certain
circumstances, only part of a system decoheres and some coherence remains.
Kauffman, 2012, places consciousness at this ‘poised state’ where part of the system decoheres
and part is coherent. The coherent state is suggested to influence the classical decoherent state.
In looking for such a system, Kauffman examines the recent research on photosynthetic
systems. In photosynthesis photons are captured by the chlorophyl molecule that is held by
antenna protein. The chlorophyl molecule maintains quantum coherence for up to 750
femtoseconds. This is longer than the classical prediction, and is viewed as responsible for the
higher than classically predicted efficiency of energy transfer. The antenna protein plays a role
in preventing more rapid decoherence, or in inducing recoherence in decohering parts of the
chlorophyll molecule. Part of the quantum system may start to decohere, but be forced back
into coherence, sometimes described as quantum error correction. Within the chlorophyll
molecule the superposition of the Schrodinger solutions allows the simultaneous exploration
of all the possible pathways. This is more efficient than the serial or one-path-at-a-time
exploration, and is taken as an explanation for the mid 90 percentage efficiency of the system,
in contrast with the 60-70% predicted for a classical system.
Kauffman thinks that the system seen in the chlorophyll molecule raises the possibility that
webs of quantum coherence or partial coherence can extend across a large part of a neuron,
and can remain poised between coherence and decoherence. Kauffman’s discussion refers to
coherent electron transport, but he recognizes that other forms of coherence such as phonons
and electron spin could be relevant.
The ‘poised state’ is supposed to span states that are between being mainly coherent and
partly decoherent. Information injected into the system can induce recoherence. The flow of
information into cells is seen as a means by which recoherence could be induced and
coherence maintained. In other writing, Kauffman, 2012 suggests a two-way flow of influence,
118

with quantum possibilities effecting classical systems, while classical systems could influence
recohering quantum systems (Fig.39).
In relating quantum coherence to consciousness, Kauffman assumes like Hameroff that
coherence would have to be sustained for the milliseconds timescales associated with neural

cycles, potentially occurring at the level of channel proteins as related to neurotransmission

superposition and a super-causal projection in a hypothesized space-time projection or
alternatively quantum geometric space time perturbations at the Planck scale (right part).

processing, rather than the femto- and picosecond timescales associated with quantum
coherence in photosynthetic organisms. It might be debatable if a direct one-to-one correlation
between processing activity and conscious episodes is necessary.

Post-Bohmian concepts of a Universal Quantum Field
The concept of a Universal knowledge field was previously also framed as Universal
Consciousness, Cosmic Consciousness, Universal Mind, Universal Memory, Universal
Intelligence, Holographic Memory, Collective Consciousness, and the Plenum, among many
119

other terms. The concept that information can take a universal character and that all
information is present in a general knowledge field can be treated from a number of
backgrounds and perspectives (see below). In principle, this item can only approached
through a general treatment of the modality of evolution of intelligence and therefore is purely
based on human knowledge: natural laws, evolutionary theories, historical analyses and
philosophy, since clearly everything we discuss and project and all we can say on observed
nature entails the product of human deliberation. One could say that there is no known source
of knowledge outside human experience.
In the above mentioned studies, the human brain is generally seen to function as an interface
between individual and such a universal consciousness. It is worthwhile therefore to take a
further look at a number of potential modalities for such an “information” domain in the
following. In the “Noetic Field Theory” of Amoroso et al. (1999), vacuum (zero-point)
quantum fluctuations and gravitation were introduced as potential mechanisms explaining
non-local information exchange. So called noetic effects couple operators of a noetic field to
specific loci of pumped Frohlich-like coherent states. This was seen as a phase regulator into
the patterns of Pribram's holonomic formations. The pumping mechanism for this process is
inherent in the self organization of the system. The radiation pressure of the Bose states,
Fermi-quasi-particle transitions, vacuum zero point fluctuations, and string dynamics are
considered to be instrumental in driving this dynamic transpersonal 'memory of being'. This
was supposed to be a dynamic Hilbert space storing archetypal forms of the personality or
psyche.
The force carrier of the electromagnetic field is the photon. At a microscopic level, therefore,
the interaction between the constituent particles of matter and the quantum vacuum involves
photons being exchanged between the virtual particles of the vacuum and the quarks and
electrons in matter. Basically, any charge in elementary matter, may distort, or "polarize", the
quantum vacuum in the immediate vicinity, through attracting virtual particles with opposite
electrical charges and repel virtual particles with similar electrical charges.
In quantum field theory, the fabric of space is visualized as consisting of fields, that at every
point in space and time exhibit a quantum harmonic oscillator, interacting with neighboring
oscillators. Further, and also critically importantly, the wave solutions are in pairs. This means
that whenever the phase arrangements of intersecting plane waves produce an electron, they
will also necessarily produce the opposite phase positron next to it (they will also have
opposite spin states). This explains matter-antimatter pair production, which is occurring
everywhere in space all the time, because space vibrates in two distinct patterns (particles and
quantum fields) that are constantly switching (see also Fig. 40). Splendid work on
teleportation, both in theory and experiment as reported in Nature by Sudbury (1997) and
Bouwmeester et al. (1997) and in line with the work by Marcer and Schempp (1997), makes it
120

clear that non-local quantum information represented by entanglement of particles in this field
could be recovered locally as useable information.

Fig. 40 : An integrated scheme depicting the Universe as a circular flow of information with its
material (right part of the figure) and mental (left), aspects. The latter does not imply a dualistic
approach, rather a complimentary and unitary matter/mind modality is assumed. This concept
assumes a central quantum information field, that provides the very basis for creation of our universe
and dynamically evolves further through cyclic feed-back processes from the present reality, in which
natural (among others human) and artificial intelligence play crucial roles in observation and
participation (see text for further explanation, see also Meijer, 2012).

Of note, if we assume a collective storage of all information that is present and/or evolves in
our Universe and that humans and other intelligent species in the cosmos interact with such a
knowledge field, it intrinsically implies that it cannot be solely treated as a by-product of our
brain and intelligence in general (Fig. 40). At first sight this conflicts with current mainstream
science and conventional pictures of reality. However the following may show that in fact
there is solid ground and even overwhelming evidence for the hypothesis/concept of a
universal knowledge field. These considerations are based on the current descriptions of
nature on the micro level (string and spin theories), quantum mechanical concepts (such as
entanglement, non-locality and resonance), cosmological models on energy (zero point energy
and negative energy) as well as holographic concepts of reality and space/time modalities. In
121

addition, universal consciousness can be approached from transcendental human experience,
including transpersonal consciousness and should be discussed against a meta-physical
background, also in relation to the phenomenon of consciousness and self-consciousness as
well as information theory (See Table 3).

In fact these collective aspects form an integral framework for the formulation for the
architecture of reality and therefore should finally be expressed in the scientific dream of a
“Theory of Everything (TOE)” that obviously should be consistent with itself, yet due to
limitations of intelligence, even in the far future, can never obtain the full status of an “final or
ultimate theory”.
Various attempts have been made earlier to define a physical basis for a universal
consciousness and/or a general information field. Apart from the seminal work of Jung and
Pauli (1955) on collective consciousness and synchronicity, and that of Bergson (1991) on
matter and memory, Bohm (1980), Susskind (1994) as well as ‘t Hooft (2001) and Bekenstein
(2003), described the world as an information storing hologram. Hagelin (1987), and Sarfatti
122

(2011) described a unified information field and a “psychosphere”, respectively, based on
quantum physics, integrating various aspects of the work of the earlier mentioned Bohm,
Berkovich, 2001 elaborated on extra-corporal and collective processing of biological
information. In the studies of Wolf (2008) tachyons (particles traveling backwards in time)
were considered as instrumental in the creation of universal consciousness and discussed in a
religious context, while Sarfatti (2011) proposed retrocausal (back from the future)
holographic image computing. Di Biase (2009a and 2009b) proposed a quantum holographic
model of brain-consciousness-universe interactions, based on the holonomic neural networks
of the ealier mentioned Karl Pribram, the holographic quantum theory developed by David
Bohm, and based on the non-locality property of the quantum field described by Umezawa, a
subject that also was thoroughly discussed by Mitchell and Staretz (2011).

Dirk Meijer: Bi-cyclic operating workspace with a top-down and bottom up
flow of information
The quantum field theories of the mind display both bottom up and top-down aspects as to
brain function, and this is also true for the various isoenergetic (emergent) processes (Meijer
and Korf, 2013). The latter would start at the Planck scale and gradually become expressed at
higher molecular and cellular levels. Interestingly, such a combined vertical counter-flux of
information (see Fig. 33) would provide an integrated cybernetic control system that may
enable highly efficient and rapid perturbations in brain function, with some delay also being
expressed at the “horizontal” neuronal network level.
Within the various domains, an optimal communication might occur between the isoenergetic
and quantum-based information flows, through wave/particle transitions as well as
coherence/decoherence cycles (horizontal arrows in Fig. 33). Within this dynamic context, the
causal (our normal) time perception and tensed time perception are separated but can be in
correlated states. The supposed interacting cycles of both the isoenergetic and quantum
mediated streams of information may exhibit nonlinear features, enabling the amplification of
minimal information signals for the realization of rapid action of the organism in relation to
interpreting the environment. In a sense this micro-model shows similarities with the
sequence- seeking and counter stream macro-model for information processing in the cortex
(Ullman, 1991).
In order to show how such a cyclic mental workspace could operate at the atomic/molecular
and field levels, Meijer, 2014, Meijer and Korf, 2013 presented one example of a potential
bidirectional information flow, that is based on the central role of Ca2+ ions under the control
of various neuronal proteins. In this concept Ca2+ is viewed upon as an informational vehicle
influencing the activity state of the neuron, (Pereira and Furlan, 2007). Similar schemes could
123

be imagined for other molecular mechanisms, mediating the tuning of cellular activity into
large scale patterns, in the context of the creation of higher mental functions. As potential
candidates, the hydrogen atom in relation to H2O and unpaired electron spins as present in
DNA, other metal ions, as well as present in O2 and NO molecules (if associated with
membrane proteins), have been proposed (Hu and Wu, 2004).
The Concept of a Bi-cyclic Operating Workspace in Brain
The quantum field theories display both bottom up and top-down aspects, and this is also true
for the various isoenergetic (emergent) processes (Korf, 2010, 2012). Top-down supervenience
was proposed to be mediated by a space-time memory domain build up during life time.
Bottom up information transfer could originate at geometric space-time at the Planck scale, as
earlier proposed by Penrose and Hameroff, 2012, and gradually may become expressed at
higher molecular and cellular levels, while vice versa, wave state reduction in the brain may
inform quantum fields on a continuous basis. Such a versatile operating bi-cyclic system may
also allow neural signal amplification as well as forward and backward causation, the latter
through holographic interference (Pribram, 1986, Mitchell and Staretz, 2011, Levin, 2012,
Germine, 2007) of past (memory) and future informational aspects.
This physically based brain structure may be instrumental in a complementary mode of recurrent
types of information processing that may be crucial for integral mental perception and
causation and can also accommodate symmetric time concepts (for the latter see:
Atmanspacher, 2011; Primas, 2009; Aharonov et al., 2010). It is proposed that such a
specialized “multi-layered” physical brain compartment, may represent a workspace in which
the two bridging and super-causal isoenergetic and quantum processes, act in concert and in a
complementary manner. The author envisions such an operating system being organized as a
number of nested, spatio-temporal, domains that allow the bidirectional flow of information
(bottom up and top-down, large arrows in the center block of Fig. 6). A multi-layered
operational organization of brain in conscious perception, requiring a nested organization of
electromagnetic fields, was recently proposed by Fingelkurts et al, 2013.
Within the various domains, an optimal communication might occur between the isoenergetic
and quantum-based information flows, through wave/particle transitions as well as
coherence/decoherence cycles (horizontal arrows in Fig. 41). In such a dynamic context, the
causal (our normal) time perception and tensed time perception are separated but can be in
correlated states (Primas, 2003). The here proposed interacting cycles of both the isoenergetic
and quantum mediated streams of information may exhibit nonlinear features (see Freeman
and Vitiello, 2008), enabling the amplification of minimal information signals for the
realization of rapid action of the organism in relation to interpreting the environment. In a
124

sense, this micro-model shows similarities with the sequence- seeking and counter stream
macro-model for information processing in the cortex (Ullman, 1991)

Fig. 41: Potential cybernetic effects on various levels of brain organization: Starting in the
upper middle part and following a sequence to the right the following elements are pictured:
spin networks on the Planck scale, superstring modalities of elementary particles, elementary
wave/particles (bosons, electrons), atomic structures such as metals and ions, molecular 3dimensional structures, cell organelles and membranes, single neurons, networks of neurons,
intercellular spaces and electromagnetic force fields, whole brain with right and left
hemispheres, brain as part of the nervous system and whole body, and finally brain as
holographic expression of cosmic consciousness. A hypothesized mental workspace is depicted
in the center with bidirectional (circular) of quantum and isoenergetic information flows. The
two domains may be quantum correlated.
It should be emphasize that the sequential steps (on the right in Fig. 41) may contain classical
neurological mechanisms, except spin- and/or string-mediated initiation events that should
be merely seen as quantum processes. At the bottom micro-level, such an information flow
may be initiated on the level of string mediated collapse of wave function (Mavromatos and
Nanopoulos, 1995) and/or may operate through spin-dependent transformation of classical
and quantum mechanical information, that may also be the basis for the so-called quantum
potential or pilot waves of the implicate order proposed by David Bohm, 1987. The
corresponding 4-dimensional space-time domain also introduces aspects of two-times physics,
tensed and causal time (see also Fig. 41).
125

As mentioned above, Penrose, 1989, proposed that spin networks could be fundamental in the
description of space-time in a background lacking manner (see for the latter also Rovelli, 1996
and Smolin, 2004). In the brain, spin-networks were pictured as electron-unpaired electron
spins that represent pixels, collectively forming a “mind screen” that is known to be highly
sensitive to fluctuating internal magnetic fields and action potentials. Such perturbations were
considered to modulate neural dynamics, but also could enhance synchronization and
stochastic resonance as have been noticed in brain (Hu and Wu, 2004). The particular spin
chemistry bridges classical neural activity, serving as input via the magnetic influences on
biochemical processing. Spin network dynamics may enable a quantum decoherence-resistant
entangled modality of wave collapse since, through tunneling, they are rather insulated from
the environment in decoherence-free subspaces, while repeated attention/intention (Zeno
effect, see Stapp, 2012), may help in promoting coherent quantum states (Hu and Wu, 2004).

Fig. 42: The role of Ca2+ ions in the bottom-up and top-down information flow from the
micro- to macro- level in the neuronal organization of the brain, as related to higher cognitive
functions and consciousness.
In order to show how such a cyclic mental workspace could operate at the atomic/molecular
and field levels, we present one example of a potential bidirectional information flow, that is
based on the central role of Ca2+ ions under the control of various neuronal proteins. In this
126

concept Ca2+ is viewed upon as an informational vehicle influencing the activity state of the
neuron, (Fig. 42, based on the data of Pereira and Furlan, 2007). Similar schemes could be
imagined for other molecular mechanisms, mediating the tuning of cellular activity into large
scale patterns, in the context of the creation of higher mental functions. As potential
candidates, the hydrogen atom in relation to H2O and unpaired electron spins as present in
DNA, other metal ions, as well as present in O2 and NO molecules (if associated with
membrane proteins), have been proposed (Hu and Wu, 2004).
The informational aspect of Ca2+ is encoded in positive and negative charges within microsites on the surface of a spectrum of flexible macromolecules that allow binary choices at
various spatio-temporal levels. The latter may also depend on ultra-rapid conformational
changes in proteins in pico-seconds, as influenced by locally induced electromagnetic fields,
that thereby obtain a probabilistic electro-magnetic vibratory character, an aspect that could
also play a role in the present isoenergetic brain model. In turn, local magnetic fields can
influence neural firing patterns and induce regional convergent zones of brain activity that are
produced through sub-threshold EPSP ‘s and inhibitory inter-neuronal synaptic activity, being
amplified by reentry and recurrent circuitry (Pereira and Furlan, 2007). The importance of
Ca2+ waves in fast strategic search algorithms in a sort of bioreaction quantum computing
was stressed by Clark (2012).
Total brain activity is determined by genetic and epigenetic information, neuro-plasticity, as
well as functional cycles of efferent and afferent signals (internal copies and external mirror
information), that reflect the interaction with the whole body and its environment and
dynamically produce our inner worldview, earlier referred to as “personal universe”(Fig. 3).
Of note, much of the sequential steps depicted in Fig. 41 and 42 are situated in single neurons.
Yet, our model, in the higher-order levels, requires an integrating modality in which the firing
patterns of millions of neuronal networks are translated in an meaningful overall brain
response. Sensory processing involves the formation of wave packets affecting large
populations of neurons, instrumental in the reciprocal broadcasting of excitatory patterns
located at several brain regions (Freeman an Vitiello, 2006), and inducing neuronal assembly.
Interestingly, in this process calcium waves along the astroglial syncitium may play a role,
contributing to collective oscillations and synchrony and thereby to efficient binding of
distributed neuronal activity. (bottom part of Fig. 42). Yet, proper information integration,
transmission and exchange with outer information domains requires a guided interactive
quantum process, in which the classical separation of sender and receiver is overcome through
an act of measurement and/or proper resonance with the information source. This implicitly
should be based on the phenomenon of entanglement and consequently on unitary and
conscious field properties of the neural and exo-systems (McFadden, 2007, John, 2001, Bohm
and Hiley, 1987). This allows the continuous exchange of meaningful information with global
127

magnetic fields as proposed by Mc Fadden, 2007 and Burke and Persinger, 2013 and/or a
universal quantum knowledge field as earlier proposed by Bohm and Hiley, 1987). The
implicate order concept was suggested to also contain personal information (our mental
double in the universal consciousness domain, (Vitiello, 1995). In order to operate in a
conscious as well as sub-conscious modes and also to enable modalities of self-consciousness,
it was proposed that apart from the known 4 dimensions at least one or two imaginary
dimensions are required (Carter 2013 a and b, Smythies, 2003), see Fig. 43.
Neural interaction sites for bridging quantum information and rapid isoenergetic
information transfer
The bottom-up and top-down vertical neural pathways as schematically depicted in Fig. 41 ,
likely form a fine-tuned organization of neurological/biochemical signature, functionally
connected with deep quantum-based information processing. This requires that each
sequential step should provide an output of the type that can be used in either of the two
supposed systems: quantum wave information should be collapsed or de-cohered to material
signals. This could occur for instance during synaptic vesicle release or through potential
Casimir effects induced by zero-point quantum fluctuations in the synaptic cleft, or
alternatively, in microtubuli (Hameroff, 2012), where material/physical information should
be translated to a wave form and vice versa.
Where in the brain, and how, could coherent wave superposition and quantum coherence
occur? A number of sites and various types of quantum interactions have been proposed.
Microtubules may indeed be an important ingredient (Hameroff and Penrose, 2013), however
various organelles and bio-molecular structures including clathrins, myelin (glial cells), presynaptic vesicular grids (Beck and Eccles, 1992) and neural membrane proteins (Marshall,
1989) might also participate. In this framework, quantum coherence may be induced by
pumping by thermal and biochemical energies (perhaps in the manner proposed by Frohlich,
1968; 1970; 1975.
As mentioned in the previous sections, it was inferred by Korf, 2010, 2012, that the ultra rapid
responses of the brain cannot be explained by classical nerve excitation, action potentials,
neurotransmitter release and further propagation and integration of neuronal activity. Instead
molecular perturbations were suggested mediating high frequency conformational changes in
neural proteins that have been shown to exhibit a vibrational state. Evidence for coherent
excitations in proteins has indeed been reported, (see for example Georgiev, 2008;Vos et al,
1993). Tests show that there is a minimum timescale of about 30 ms needed for a subject to
distinguish two sensory inputs as being separate. This means that consciousness cannot be
slower than 30 ms. However, patients with time agnosia, who have subjective experience of
the passage of time, confirm that it is physically possible to have consecutive conscious steps
128

that are experienced as simultaneous. From this it is argued that the real units of consciousness
could be at the picoseconds level, although such units cannot be discerned by the conscious
subject.
The poised realm of reversible coherence/ de-coherence process (Kauffman, 2012a, 2012b,
could be situated in micro-sites that house such a conversion capability (Fig. 39).
Mathematician Shor, 1996 proved a quantum error correction theorem for quantum
computers. If quantum degrees of freedom in a quantum computer are de-cohering due to loss
of phase information from the computer (the system) to its environment, then Shor showed
that if information is added to the system from the outside, the decohering degrees of freedom
could be made to recohere again. Recoherence can occur, for instance, being driven by
coherent electromagnetic field whose intensity and period distribution can be tuned nonrandomly, thereby injecting information that results in a new controlled superposition state
(Kauffman, 2012b). This clearly says that re-coherence is, in principle, possible. This idea finds
support in the papers of physicist Briegel, 2006 showing that a quantum coherent "entangled"
system can decohere to classicity than recohere to quantum entangled coherence.

Fig. 43: Consciousness and the self requires at least five physical dimensions ( see Carter, 2013
and Smythies, 2003).
129

In looking for such a system, Vattay at al, 2012), examined the recent research on quantum
properties of photosynthetic systems (reviewed by Arndt, 2010, Lloyd, 2012). In
photosynthesis photons are captured by the chlorophyl molecule that is held by antenna
protein. The chlorophyl molecule maintains quantum coherence for up to 750 femtoseconds.
This is much longer than the classical prediction, and is viewed as responsible for the higher
than classically predicted efficiency of energy transfer. The particular antenna protein plays a
role in preventing more rapid decoherence, or in inducing recoherence in decohering parts of
the chlorophyll molecule. Part of the quantum system may start to decohere, but be forced
back into coherence, described by the abovementioned quantum error correction. Kauffman
thinks that this raises the possibility that webs of quantum coherence or partial coherence can
extend across a large part of a neuron, and can remain poised between coherence and
decoherence (Fig. 39).
In relating quantum coherence to consciousness, Kauffman assumes like Hameroff that
coherence would have to be sustained for the milliseconds timescales associated with neural
processing, rather than the femto- and picosecond timescales associated with quantum
coherence in photosynthetic organisms.
Hameroff and Penrose, 2011, 2012, required quantum coherence to be sustained for 25 ms.
Tegmark’s, 2005 paper, aimed at refuting Hameroff’s Orch OR theory did not consider
coherence over shorter timescales, because he was directing his argument at the longer
timescales of Hameroff’s primary theory. Georgiev, 2000, queried whether there is any
evidence that consciousness has to arise over a milliseconds timescale. If consciousness could
operate over a picosecond or shorter timescale, then Tegmark’s calculations do not present any
problem for quantum consciousness.
In addition to vertical bottom up and top down information transfer, rather separately
organized neurological and quantum pathways could “horizontally” communicate by
correlated time domains or be helped by local resonant or entanglement properties (see Fig. 41
and 39). In this respect, a number of potential intra-neuronal and inter-neuronal connective
mechanisms should be taken into account. Solitons, described as dissipative waves or
tunneling bio-photons, have been proposed as intracellular local effectors by Georgiev and
Glazebrook, 2006; Dotta, 2012. Interestingly, even a process of photon quantum teleportation
(Salari et al., 2010) have been suggested for long distance signaling in the brain, a process that
both employs classical and quantum elements. Ehresmann et al., 2011, stresses the dynamic
character of a multi-scale flexible brain structure, varying over time and with a hierarchy of
complexification levels, in which higher cognitive and mental processes can develop. This
occurs within a 5-dimensional global landscape with retrospective and prospective elements
that, among others, result in changes in the synchronization of neuronal assemblies as well as
dynamic adaption of neuronal contacts. In this sense the dynamic flow of information in the
130

brain may mirror the circular flow as it occurs from the micro- to macro scale in the whole
universe and vice versa (Fig. 44).
Such a multidimensional space/time brain structure, being open to external electromagnetic
and quantum fields, could also provide an interpretation framework for understanding of the,
until now, non-comprehensible time delays in subconscious and conscious perception, the
inner knowing of qualia as well as the subjective experience of transpersonal and extrasensory events such as intuition, serendipity, clairvoyance and telepathy ( Libet, 2001, 2006,
Jahn and Dunne, 2004).
In summary: A double “countercurrent” operating workspace in the brain is postulated (see
Fig. 41), representing a complementary mode of isoenergetic and quantum information
processing. This workspace houses cycling (vertically and horizontally interacting)
information flows that may be instrumental in highly rapid mental perception and causation
and can accommodate time symmetry as well as nonlinear elements. The vertically directed
cycle of flow includes interaction with electromagnetic and quantum fields that enable vice
versa exchange of information with a universal knowledge field.

Zero-point energy: the vacuum
Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of what are usually called ''zero-point'' energies for
the strong, the weak and the electromagnetic interactions, where ''zero-point'' refers to the
energy of the system at temperature T=0, or the lowest quantized energy level of a quantum
mechanical system. Zero-point energy is the energy that remains when all other energy is
removed from a system. A harmonic oscillator is a useful conceptual tool in physics.
Classically, a harmonic oscillator, such as a mass on a spring, can always be brought to rest.
However a quantum harmonic oscillator does not permit this. A residual motion will always
remain due to the requirements of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, resulting in a zeropoint energy, equal to 1/2 hf, where f is the oscillation frequency. Zero-point energy was
experimentally demonstrated with the so called Casimir Effect, a unique attractive quantum
force between closely-spaced metal plates. Casimir force was shown to be due to radiation
pressure from the background electromagnetic zero-point energy which has become
unbalanced due to the presence of the plates, and which results in the plates being pushed
together. (Fig. 45)
Electromagnetic radiation can be pictured as waves flowing through space at the speed of
light. The waves are not waves of anything substantive, but are ripples in a state of a
theoretically defined field. However these waves do carry energy (and momentum), and each
wave has a specific direction, frequency and polarization state. Each wave represents a
''propagating mode of the electromagnetic field.'' Each mode is equivalent to a harmonic
oscillator and is thus subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From this line of
reasoning, quantum physics predicts that all of space must be filled with electromagnetic zeropoint fluctuations (also called the zero-point field) creating a universal sea of zero-point
energy. The density of this energy depends critically on where in frequency the zero-point
fluctuations cease. Since space itself is thought to break up into a kind of quantum foam at a
tiny distance scale called the Planck scale (10-33 cm), it is argued that the zero point fluctuations
must cease at a corresponding Planck frequency (1043 Hz). If that is the case, the zero-point
energy density would be 110 orders of magnitude greater than the radiant energy at the center
of the Sun).
Zero-point energy has the desired property of driving an accelerated expansion, and thus
having the requisite properties of dark energy, but to an absurdly greater degree than
required, i.e. 120 orders of magnitude. Work by Christian Beck, and Michael Mackey, 2006
may have resolved the 120 order of magnitude problem. In that case dark energy is nothing
other than zero-point energy. In “Measureability of vacuum fluctuations and dark energy”
and “Electromagnetic dark energy” they propose that a phase transition occurs so that zeropoint photons below a frequency of about 1.7 THz are gravitationally active whereas above
that they are not. If this is the case, then the dark energy problem is solved: dark energy is the
low frequency gravitationally active component of zero-point energy. SED studies published
132

in the 1990s showed that a massless point-charge oscillator accelerating through the zero-point
field will experience a Lorentz force (from the magnetic components of the zero-point
fluctuations) that turns out to be directly proportional to acceleration, allowing the derivation
of the fundamental F=ma relationship of mechanics from electrodynamics. This points to the
electromagnetic quantum vacuum as the origin of forces which appear as inertial mass.
Andrei Linde, in a seminal article in 2003 , postulated that our rather homogeneous part of
the universe emerged from a chaotic initial state and that the universe may consist of different
exponentially large domains where the properties of elementary particles may be different.
According to quantum field theory, the so called empty space is filled with quantum fluctuations, a
scalar field that grew during inflation, which also may have led to different domains with different
properties. Our part of the universe is considered to be a selection with specific inflation
conditions in which the physical constants take values that enabled our kind of life. According
to Linde, this provides a simple justification for the so called Anthropic principle (Barrow and
Tipler, 1986) and does not require a multiverse concept. The question than arose how the
laws of Nature in our part in the universe became into existence. The answer formulated by
the author is very much in line with the principles of quantum physics: the final structure
becomes only fixed after measurements are performed!

Fig. 43 : Left: The universal, all pervading "zero energy field" as a vacuum with fluctuations of
quantum waves or particle/antiparticles (insets right). Through superposition and photon
133

polarization) information storage is possible. Two plates at a very narrow distance (left below) show
attraction since the virtual particles outside can exert more pressure than the spatially expelled
particles inside (the so called Casimir effect that demonstrated the universal presence of zero point
energy). The anti-particles travel in a reversed time mode.

This implies that the final fine tuning of our world somehow is closely related to the evolution
of life and consciousness. If our universe is a wave function, without observers or participants
it would be a dead universe. Our knowledge of the world begins not with matter but with
perceptions, said Linde, 2005. It is possible that consciousness, like spacetime has its own
degrees of freedom and that neglecting it leads to a description of the universe that is
fundamentally incomplete. He finally stated: all matter in the universe was produced with
quantum fluctuations after the end of inflation. Quantum effects combined with inflation
made the universe not only infinitely large but also immortal and afforded a beautiful and
self-consistent pattern. Are we uncovering the universal truth or does this beauty rather
deceives us? We should be kept in touch with solid and well established facts, without
forgetting the urge of scientific freedom and speculation.

Amit Goswami: The vacuum as universal information field

Quantum aspects of life
The following section largely sites and summarizes the excellent article of Goswami, 2005.
“Morphogenesis, the growth of a complete organism from a single cell embryo, is a
phenomenon of biological order of unprecedented precision timing of correlated events of
both spatial and temporal nature. One doesn't see anything like this in dealing with inanimate
matter. Naturally, beginning with Erwin Schrodinger, 1959, 1986, an impressive group of
scientists have suggested that the currently known laws of physics may not be enough to
explain morphogenesis. Many biologists have propounded the idea of a morphogenetic field -a condition of space that retains the memory of the form that the embryo evolves towards
under the guidance of the fields. But these earlier works hold on to the concept of local fields
and also to the materialist belief in "upward causation" -- the supremacy of matter as the cause
of everything.

134

But morphogenesis, as proposed by Sheldrake, 2005, has overtones of teleology (the idea that
some final purpose is driving the system) to many. One has recently injected new principles in
the old idea of morphogenetic fields to incorporate teleology, non-locality, and downward
causation. Sheldrake’s morphogenetic fields are purposive and non-local. They are not
material. They are capable of downward causation in matter through a new principle called
"morphic resonance". As soon as a new form comes about, it sets up its own field which is
continually reinforced with its ongoing replication, thus explaining the memory exhibited in
morphogenesis. However, there is the fundamental question of the source of the
morphogenetic fields that resonate with matter, since this exhibits an implicit dualism.
The purpose of the following section is to show that although dualistic in its original form,
morphogenesis can be given sound footing on the basis of Quantum principles applied in the
conceptualization of the living cell within the context of a new science -- science within
consciousness, a science based on the primacy of consciousness. This will take up the necessity
of a new formulation of biology within the primacy of consciousness and indicate how
morphogenesis theory is a precursor and a special case of this new theory. The dualist
objections against this new are next resolved. A quantum explanation of morphic resonance is
then given. The question of experimental verification is briefly discussed.
How Form is Remembered
A real problem of morphogenesis is non-locality -- how local interactions can control global
development. How does a cell in the big toe know where it is with respect to the whole body
so that its function in form-making is switched 'on' appropriately so that the cell can do what
is required of it at its position in the toe? If the blueprint of switching is itself in the DNA (as
materialist biologists would have it), then how does the toe cell know only to activate the
relevant part of the blueprint? We can see that there has to be a "metaplan" -- a meta-blueprint
that functions in a non-local way, both spatially and temporally. Somehow the micro DNA
strand of one single cell has to exert influence on a vast collection of cells spread across a
Macro region of spatial volume and over the whole time that the embryo development takes
In materialist theories (apart from the concept of particles), there is also the concept of "force
fields". The difference between the two concepts is interesting. Whereas particles are discrete,
fields form a continuum. They have a wholeness. For example, if we cut a magnet that
generates a magnetic field, we get two of the same magnetic field -- not two halves of the
original one. This generates the idea that perhaps the holistic field concept has some
usefulness for discussing a holistic phenomenon such as morphogenesis in biology.
The field concept has been used in biology quite powerfully and in connection with
morphogenesis by the theoretical biologist Waddington who had a flare for language. He
135

created important words in his characterization of the morphogenetic field called "chreode",
which is a "canalized" pathway in an "epigenetic landscape". As an illustration, consider the
motion of the ball sliding down a landscape of hills and valleys. The ball follows particular
valleys. Its motion downward is canalized. Similarly, the development of particular parts of
the embryo is canalized toward particular end points. The canalized motion of the ball is
relatively immune to perturbation because of the hills that separate it from other neighboring
valleys. Similarly, said Waddington, the canalized development of the embryo is also immune
to small amounts of environmental perturbations. But Waddington's fields -- interesting as
they are as an idea -- will not do for morphogenesis for they are local.
So is it the morphogenetic field that tells the particular DNA of a cell which part of the formmaking plan to activate? They can if a plan is stored in the fields themselves which are nonlocal. Suppose the DNA are just receivers (like radio receivers) rather than the generators of
the information of the plan. Radio receivers can receive a signal because they resonate with the
electromagnetic wave of the signal. Similarly, the DNAs receive the morphogenetic signal (the
instructions for activation of a particular part) via morphic resonance.

Fig. 46: Perception of Universal consciousness at all levels (middle), requires a holistic approach to
cultural, historic and personal experience of reality

Thus morphogenesis explicitly deviates from materialist models of biology where everything
is assumed to be the product of upward causation, emergent as they may be. Morphic
resonance is one way of introducing downward causation in biology. The purposeiveness
exhibited in biological form-making arises from this downward causation.
136

Of course, since the plan is global and non-local, morphogenetic fields also have to be nonlocal. And here, the theory is departing from the philosophy of scientific or material realism
(according to which nothing can exist outside of matter and its rules of locality). And the
theory is explicit about the non-locality of his "morphic" (short for morphogenetic) fields -- a
non-locality, he says, that may even be of Quantum origin. Morphic resonance is also
postulated to be the basis of memory or repetition of living forms. Morphic resonance consists
of influence of "like upon like" previous patterns of form on present patterns of form,
reinforcing the pooled memory of the species. In this way, morphic fields are different from
any other postulated in biology by virtue of his bold hypothesis of (a) downward causation
and purposiveness; (b) non-locality; and (c) morphic resonance with memory property.
Indeed, with these properties of morphic fields, all of the difficulties of biological
morphogenesis of materialist theories are resolved. But morphic field theory, seemingly has an
implicit dualism, if postulated to transcend matter. They are capable of influencing matter.
Resonance phenomenon in radio needs electromagnetic wave propagation between a source
and a receptor. In this theory, there is the receptor (the living object) and there is the
information being received (the morphogenetic fields). But the source is left ambiguous and
implicit. But leaving out the source of morphogenetic information is the reason that one
cannot explain how the first such field comes into being. He leaves it to "some inherent
creative intelligence in mind and nature" (Fig.46).
This intuition is correct, and that this intelligence is consciousness itself, looked upon as the
ground of all being. Consciousness acts on matter in conjunction with a vital body that
contains the blueprints of biological forms. That is the source of morphic information. And the
function of morphic fields and resonance is carried out by consciousness simultaneously
choosing actuality from possibility forms of both the vital and the physical body of an
organism. And yet, this process does not involve dualism. Instead, the process involves selfreferential quantum measurement (see later).
Who Programs?
Materialist biologists talk about programs of morphogenesis stored in DNA, but are confused
by the question of who programs the DNA, the biocomputer? The only answer for the
materialist is environmental conditioning driven by competition for survival and natural
selection. Furthermore, as Gregory Bateson pointed out a long time ago, computer learning is
low-level learning. It is learning by producing memory. Computers cannot learn the context of
learning. In other words, they can learn within fixed contexts, but they cannot change contexts.
In other words, genetic programming may be adequate for understanding morphogenesis
under ordinary circumstances, but not for situations where regulation or regeneration of forms
137

(see later) takes place. Nor is genetic programming able to explain how a new context for
morphogenesis is learned.
Another difficulty with the concept of genetic programming, within the strict materialist
philosophy, is that classical programs can never simulate non-local behavior. So even with
genes forming a cooperative program, can we understand the non-locality of morphogenesis
with this concept?
In science within consciousness, we propose that there is a creative programmer -- consciousness
itself. Consciousness is creative and changes the contexts of learning in the programs of the
living cell. Not only is morphogenesis explainable with this hypothesis but also is the
evolution of new forms. And not only morphogenesis and evolution, but the door is also
opened to understand Life itself as a manifestation of consciousness as different from
insentient matter.
For Life, there has to be a new organizing principle. But it is unlikely that such organizing
principles reside in matter emerging at the appropriate level of complexity. But if downward
causation and purpose are phenomena of consciousness, and if consciousness is the
organizing principle for Life, how does consciousness intervene into the behavior of matter
that make up the world of manifestation? If the world really ran by Newtonian laws, there
would be no way for such intervention. Fortunately, the world is not Newtonian. Ever since
the beginning of this century we have been discovering the novelties of a new mechanics that
originated with the study of motion of submicroscopic objects. The matter of the world obeys
this new mechanics called Quantum Mechanics. But this mechanics lacks closure, thus making
room for consciousness to intervene in the affairs of matter. Quantum Mechanics -- broadly
interpreted within the philosophy that consciousness is the ground of all being (perennial
philosophy or monistic idealism) -- gives us an adequate science of becoming in the biological
world.
There is one more important question -- the question of meaning. Computers process symbols
but not the meaning of symbols. The meaning exists in the mind of the programmer.
Computer scientists routinely assume such a psychophysical parallelism in their theories as
discussed by Varela, Thomson, and Rosch, 1991, and even by Dennett, 2007. Similarly, the
meaning of living functions and attributes such as maintenance, reproduction, evolution, and
form must be carried in a separate body within consciousness. This body is traditionally called
the "vital body. In summary, we need a theory of bio-physical parallelism -- a simultaneous
and parallel functioning of a vital body and a physical body. But the introduction of the vital
body (and consciousness) in biology surely raises the specter of dualism. It is the solution of
the problem of dualism with the help of quantum measurement theory that makes science
within consciousness a viable concept for biology.
138

How Consciousness Creates Biological Order Without Dualism
It is well-known that Quantum Mechanics is not deterministic but probabilistic. Quantum
mathematics (the Schrodinger equation) calculate possibility waves (the wave functions, the
square of which determines probability). Normally for doing physics and chemistry, since one
is always dealing with myriad objects, the probability calculus works in a statistically
deterministic fashion and dealing with grave questions of philosophy can be postponed. But
this is not possible in certain situations of biology because a single system -- such as a single
living cell (assuming that there is a quantum mechanism within the cell) -- is involved.
For a single system, the question of quantum measurement become paramount. Who-or-what
collapses the possibility wave into actuality? The possibility wave is a superposition of
eigenstates. The process of measurement is always found to have reduced the superposition
into a single eigenstate. But what causes this reduction? The mathematician John von
Neumann said that consciousness does. When we look, when we measure, we choose the
space-time actuality from superpositions of possibilities that exist in transcendent potentia.
But von Neumann's idea that it is consciousness that brings into being the world of
manifestation from the transcendent possibility waves of Quantum Mechanics met with
considerable resistance. It was labeled dualistic. How can consciousness act on matter without
violating the law of Conservation of Energy? If there are two simultaneous observers, whose
choice counts for the outcome? Many alternative resolutions of the quantum measurement
problem were proposed (e.g. hidden variables) to close down this window of idealism. But
none succeeded.
Progress toward opening the window of monistic idealism came in 3 steps. The first step was
an epoch-making discovery by the theorist John Bell in 1966. Bell showed that the
introduction of hidden variables into Quantum Mmechanics (i.e., a resolution of the quantum
measurement problem suggested by many physicists) conflicts with the locality principle of
material realism -- that influence can propagate only within the Einsteinian speed-of-light
limit. But the basic non-locality of Quantum Mechanics has been verified experimentally by
Alain Aspect and his collaborators in France.
In the crucial second step, ignoring conventional wisdom, E. Harris Walker, 2000 Fred Alan
Wolf, 1996, Ludwig Bass, 1971, Stuart et al, 1978, Henry Stapp, 2009 and Beck and Eccles,
2003, all proposed -- implicitly or explicitly -- that our consciousness is related to the processes
of quantum measurement in the brain. This opened the door for the third step. The
measurement problem is squarely resolved when we turn the metaphysics of science upside
down and posit consciousness as the ground of all being and thus -- having causal efficacy -downward causation. What else can we say about a consciousness that collapses the quantum
139

possibility wave into actuality? All objects are quantum objects. Therefore, any machine -such as the ones called "measurement apparatuses" that we use to amplify a quantum
phenomenon -- itself becomes a possibility wave (a superposition of Macroscopically
distinguishable possibilities) when in contact with micro-quantum possibility waves that they
purport to measure. This includes such measurement apparatuses in our brain.
Consciousness can collapse the whole conglomerate because it transcends the material
Universe. Does such collapse constitute mind over matter? No, consciousness transcends the
brain, whose states exist as possibilities within consciousness before collapse. Collapse consists
of recognition and choice of one of these possibilities. The human brain may thereby function
as an interface between personal and universal consciousness (Fig. 47).
If transcendent consciousness is always looking and collapsing, quantum possibilities would
never develop and all the wonderful phenomena of quantum physics that give us the
technologies of computers, lasers, and superconductors would be impossible. This is called a
"tangled hierarchy" because the causal efficacy does not lie entirely with either the subject or
the predicate but instead fluctuates unendingly between them.
Thus, realizing that the quantum measurement in an observer's brain is a tangled-hierarchical
process helps us to understand our self-reference -- our capacity to look at the (collapsed)
object of our observation separate from us, the subjects. Note also that this subject-object split
is only appearance, just as the self-referential separation in the liar's paradox of the sentence
from the rest of the world of discourse is only appearance. The subject that collapses, that
chooses, that observes (or measures), that experiences dependently co-arises with awareness
of the object(s) that are observed and experienced. They dependently co-arise (as appearance)
from one undivided, transcendent consciousness and its possibilities. When consciousness
identifies with the subject, there is (apparent) separation -- the subject-object split. Notice how,
in this description, dualism is avoided because ultimately there is only undivided
consciousness.
Notice also that the self of self-reference in the quantum measurement of an unlearned
stimulus operates with complete freedom to choose from the macroscopically distinguishable
quantum possibilities offered by the brain (in other words, with creativity). However, due to
conditioning, the freedom of choice is compromised for a learned stimulus. As a result of
experience, the self thus acquires a conditioned mode, conventionally called the "ego".
Therefore, in a self-referential system, consciousness can act in and identify with 2 different
modalities: one is creative or quantum modality, and the other is conditioned or classical
determined modality, as was also proposed by Vitiello.
To make quantum measurement theory relevant in biology, we must postulate that selfreferential quantum measurement already takes place in the living cell and is responsible for
140

the split of one consciousness and its possibilities into life and environment. This gives us a
profound distinction of the living as opposed to non-living. This also opens the door for the
explanation of both creative and conditioned modalities of biological evolution in the theory of
punctuated equilibrium. According to this theory, the famous fossil gaps represent rapid
evolution that gives rise to speciation. In between rapid epochs of speciation, there is gradual
neo-Darwinian evolution which maintains species homeostasis. In the present theory, the
rapid evolution is due to discontinuous, creative quantum leaps in the quantum mechanism of
gene mutation in the cell. In between, the cell operates in the conditioned modality which is
continuous and gradual -- in other words, neo-Darwinian. Now to the problem of bio-physical
parallelism introduced in the previous section, how can we avoid dualism there?

141

Fig. 47: The human brain acting as an interface between individual and universal consciousness. The
working space of the brain is depicted as a 3-dimensional incept of in a 4-dimensional space (pink
ellipse), allowing input of information from both the past and future. This information includes ESP
and PSI signals, the intensity of which is determined from emotional history and the emotional
projections from anticipation the future.

Avoiding Dualism in Bio-physical Parallelism
Vitalism was rejected in biology because of its problem with interaction dualism (faced by all
Cartesian type of dualism in general). If there are two separate dual bodies, what mediates
their interaction and without violating conservation laws such as the Conservation of Energy?
If the vital body exists in a parallel existence with the physical in exact correspondence
(biophysical parallelism as enunciated by Leibnitz), the problem of dualism still larks. What
maintains the exact correspondence? The solution that quantum measurement theory gives us
is this: consciousness mediates the parallelism between the physical and the vital body. This is
not dualism, because consciousness simultaneously collapses (non-locally) the quantum
possibilities of the physical and vital bodies for its self-referential experience. These quantum
superposition of possibilities already exists within consciousness which is only choosing by
recognizing a particular possibility. Thus, it is not "mind over matter". This resolution of the
problem of dualism requires that the vital body be a quantum body (i.e., its states describable
by Quantum Mechanics as waves of possibility).
142

Evidence for the quantum nature of the vital body is found in the demonstration of nonlocality. Qigong masters can non-locally affect the vital field of plants enough to enhance or
reduce the rate of biochemical reactions involved in plant growth. Quantum objects obey the
uncertainty principle. That is, we cannot simultaneously measure both their position and
velocity with utmost accuracy. In order to determine the trajectory of an object, we need to
know not only where an object is now but also where it will be a little later. In other words,
both position and velocity simultaneously. So we can never determine accurate trajectories of
quantum objects.
Although the macro-bodies of our environment are made of the micro quantum objects that
obey the uncertainty principle because of their grossness, the cloud of ignorance that the
uncertainty principle imposes on their motion is very small. So small that it can be discounted
in most situations. This is the so called “correspondence principle”. Thus, macro-bodies can be
attributed both approximate position and approximate momentum and, therefore, trajectories
(their possibility waves spread, but extremely sluggishly). For the physical world, we use the
intermediary of the macro-bodies (a macro "measurement" apparatus) to amplify the states of
the micro quantum objects before we can observe them. This is the price we pay, loosing direct
contact with the microcosm so that we have a shared reality of physical objects in the
macrocosm. Everybody can simultaneously see the physical macro-bodies. But vital substance
is indivisible. For this substance, there is no reduction to smaller-and-smaller bits. There is no
micro out of which the macro is made. The vital world is a whole or what physicists
sometimes call an "infinite medium". There are waves in this infinite medium -- modes of
movement that must be described as quantum possibility waves obeying a probability
calculus. And we directly observe these quantum without the intermediary of the Macro
measurement apparatus (there isn't any). But there is a price that we pay for the direct
experience. The observation and experience of the vital modes of movement are subject to the
uncertainty principle. What this means is that any observation disturbs the vital object so
much so that another observation would not lead to the same experience. Therefore, experience
cannot ordinarily be shared by two different observers. I is private, since it is experienced
internally. In this sense a mental expression of individuality, operating in 5 dimensions can be
inferred (Fig.48).
Further note that the quantum picture enables us to think about the physical and the vital
worlds differently from what we are used to. Normally, we tend to think of both of these
worlds as made of substances (something "concrete"). Sure, the vital substance is more subtle.
We cannot quantify it in the same way as we can the physical. But it is still a substance, or so
we think. We must change our view. Even the physical is not substance in the ordinary sense,
let alone the "vital". Both physical and vital worlds remain as quantum superposition of
possibilities until consciousness gives them substantiality by collapsing an actual experience.
143

Fig. 48: The human mind is positioned in a 4-dimensional domain, that may be constituted by a
universal knowledge field (physically the zero-point energy field), in contact with its individual life
line that consists of subsequent binary choices (upper right inset). The observer (soul) of the individual
mind and its history is situated in a 5th dimension, (up left cartoon).

The quantum system in the cell along with Macro-measurement apparatuses that amplify its
states (and also make a record of the actualized states upon measurement) -- whose states are
collapsed in a correlated parallel fashion with the states of the vital body -- can be said to have
mapped the blueprint, the meaning, contained in the latter. This is similar to how we write
software on computer hardware. The maps are inherited by all the cells of the body of a multicellular organism through cell division. The shared maps can solve some of the profound
puzzles of biological morphogenesis.
Non-locality in Morphogenesis
The embryo of a highly-developed organism starts as a homogeneous structure-less entity that
develops in successive stages that shows the evolutionary history of the organism.
In materialism, we look for a materialistic beginning for everything. All development must be
contained within the reductive components and their interactions. Materialist biologists now
believe that the genes -- the DNA of the embryo cell -- contains a blueprint of the form that
develops. The DNA is analogized to a computer. Its components behave according to
144

programs that contains all the necessary instructions for cell differentiation. But as already
mentioned, there is a grave problem in this kind of thinking.

Fig. 49: A schematic representation of resonance of two sources of wave information A and B
The problem is this. How can local interactions among the components of the DNA give rise to
such spectacular non-local correlations as exhibited by morphogenesis? If we think of the
DNA as a computer, a classical computer, then the problem is that a classical computer can
never simulate non-locality as shown by the physicist Richard Feynman. But if we assume a
quantum component to the computing machinery of the cell, then non-locality is no longer a
problem, and together with resonance (Fig. 49) may be instrumental in instructing the
organism. It is readily recognized that biological correlations exhibited in morphogenesis are
not only correlations that persist over distances but also over time. The distance correlations
can be understood easily as the play of quantum non-locality. But how about the correlation
over time? It turns out that the latter is also the play of quantum -non-locality. The name of
this particular play is "delayed choice" of John Wheeler. The crucial point is that in the
quantum picture, the morphogenetic forms take shape first as possibility forms. They are not
manifest until a bifurcation of form occurs that necessitates choice. Such a bifurcation may
involve a particular form that occurred in the past or a brand new form. Once collapse occurs,
the entire causal pathway leading to the chosen form manifests at once as if by "delayed
choice". Obviously this seems a teleological and future-oriented choice of form. But delayed
choice is a well-known characteristic of non-locality in quantum measurement. It has been
verified by laboratory experiments.

145

Evolution and Morphogenesis: a Quantum explanation of Morphic Resonance
The lesson of the "delayed choice" -- that possibilities can wait in limbo until consciousness
chooses actuality from among them - is crucial to understand not only morphogenesis but also
the creative quantum leap in evolution and how evolution and morphogenesis work together
to map the meaning-forms of the vital body onto the physical as physical forms.
According to neo-Darwinian dogma, evolution is gradual. But a creative change requires
many individual micro mutations at the gene level working together making a Macromutation that gives rise to a new phenotype trait leading to a new species. If neo-Darwinist
ideas of selection on every individual mutation were at work, most mutations -- since
individually they are not beneficial -- would be eliminated. But why assume that individual
mutations are selected for or against? It is a fact that mutations (either point mutations or
mutations acquired in gene recombination) are quantum in nature. They are mere
superpositions of possibilities before consciousness has collapsed them. Suppose the quantum
superpositions of mutated genes wait in limbo until enough of them accumulate to give rise to
a phenotype trait leading to new form. Not only the gene mutations are quantum processes,
but also the making of form from genes (morphogenesis). Both evolution (of the mutated
genes) and morphogenesis of the new trait wait in limbo as superpositions of many
possibilities, from among which consciousness can see a pattern that is just right for mapping
a meaning-blueprint contained in its vital body. See also Davies, 2004.
Why should a form that occurred in the past be chosen? The answer is that forms are
conditioned as part of the developmental history of Life. Initially, forms exist as degenerate
multitudes of coherent superposition, and the choice among them requires creativity and
purposiveness. However, a collapse of a self-referential quantum system conditions the
system. Thus once a form has manifested through a creative breakthrough, the probability of
its repetition increases. In biology, since all life is connected to some first living cell,
conditioning propagates down-the-line throughout the tree of Life. This is the explanation of
why certain forms repeat over-and-over in morphogenesis. In a sense, this is a kind of
memory, and its manifestation does involve non-locality. But the mechanism is quantum. In
other words, we have arrived at all the virtues of the theory of morphic resonance without the
implicit dualism.
Conclusions: The theory of formative causation via a physical information field and
bidirectional interaction through morphic resonance will go down in history as a bold
departure in the right direction, in that it introduces many of the right elements -- downward
causation, purpose, and non-locality -- in this theory. Because of its initiative, the theory
inspired many scientists to investigate similar ideas in other fields. Measurement is seen as a
tangled-hierarchical and produces self-reference -- our ability to distinguish between us,
146

subjects, and the objects we experience. The theory does not contain an implicit dualism,
recognizing that consciousness is the creative organizing principle behind biological evolution
and morphogenesis of organism and brain”.
Comments of Bromberg on Goswami’s monistic idealism theory
The concept of Goswami was critically discussed by Bromberg, 2000. We cite from this article:
“Science is experiencing one of the most difficult challenges of all history: to explain human
most basic capacity, the mental. It was for long thought that human mental abilities were
insurmountable difficult to understand and therefore excluded to transcendental and
disconnected world and relegated to religion. But the advent of the paradoxes in our
understanding of the physical world, plus the undergoing serious and spread research in
artificial intelligence and cognitive science faced science with the necessity of dealing with the
mysteries of the mind (Bromberg, 2000).
Every single discipline in humanity has something to say on the issue: science, religion, art,
poetry, etc. But none has yet the capacity of proving its assumptions. If Dyer's, 1994 AI
enterprise is successful in explaining consciousness and the mental, then we scientist,
Goswami included, will have to welcome it, but if on the other hand, quantum mechanics
appears to be more than a mathematical practical tool and shows to contains ontological
relevance then scientist, including Dyer, will certainly have to accept it. But science discoveries
not only take time but resources, and for that we should try to stop an evidently contradictory
theory.
With the introduction of Goswami's alternative model of nature, Science is left with (at least)
two opposite models: materialistic realism and monistic idealism. Since none of them is not yet
usefulness. Goswami claims his new theory overcome some inconsistencies (paradoxes) of
materialistic realism and completes Cognitive science with the inclusion of the "subjective". If
his claims were true, his theory would clearly outrun materialistic realism. Any attempt then
to keep materialistic realism as the more plausible model, needs to attack those claims. Dyer,
instead of arguing the invalidity of his argumentation - that his theory does overcome those
inconsistencies - he attack his argumentations by discarding the existences of the
inconsistencies: "Idealist science is not needed because cognitive science is already developing
computer programs which can emulate human creativity, ethics and free will". Moreover,
Dyer never discuss the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, paradoxes in the materialistic
realism model. Thus, even if Dyer's enterprise were successful, it would leave monistic
idealism with the same level of credibility of materialistic realism. This is what is pretended to
be argued, not that Dyer is incorrect in his attacks, but incomplete. He does not then
succeeded in undermining Goswami's theory, at most he may have succeeded in leaving it at
the same level of credibility than materialistic realism.
147

The current undergoing lines of research in both materialistic (algorithmic) and idealistic
(nonalgorithmic) Cognitive Sciences have many adepts each, with strong evidence of
correctness and consistency in each of them. Probably it is the case that Goswami theory is not
only correct but inclusive of current algorithmic Cognitive Science as Goswami claims. In such
a case both lines of research will not only survive but contribute positively to Science.
In the meanwhile, Bromberg, 2000, believes that both lines has chances and he does not see
any strong reason for eliminating any of them. A key point is that quantum downward
causation of choice is discontinuously exerted (if it were continuous, a mathematical model
could be constructed for it and the choice would be predictable and not free), but our ordinary
state of consciousness smoothes out the discontinuity. To be aware that we choose is to wake
up to the non-ordinary oneness taking a discontinuous leap. In this way, the dictum of the
new physics is: I choose, therefore I am (my cosmic quantum self).
So the new paradigm of reality based on the rediscovery of consciousness within science is not
only giving us back our free will, but also is identifying the source of that free will as the spirit
within us, the oneness that spiritual traditions have always propounded. The new paradigm is
showing us great promise for integrating science and spirit and art. It is also promising a
breakthrough integral approach to medicine that integrates conventional and alternative
medicine”.

Simon Ragget: A final attempt to formulate a theory of consciousness
At this stage, we might think we have covered enough ground to try to put together a theory
of consciousness that has explanatory power, and is not obviously at variance with what we
know about physics, neuroscience or evolution.
We have tried to define consciousness, as our subjective experience, or as the fact of it ‘being
like something’ to experience things. Consciousness also involves our subjective awareness of
the real or apparent ability to subjectively envisage future scenarios, and to use these for our
choice of actions. We have further suggested that there is only one problem with
consciousness, the problem of how qualia or subjective experience arises, and that we have to
address this and essentially only this in discussing consciousness.
We have examined theories of consciousness that operate within the context of classical
physics, and always come up against essentially the same explanatory gap. Classical physics
gives a full explanation of the relationships of macroscopic matter, without any need for
consciousness, and also without any ability to generate consciousness. This creates a problem
as to how the brain can generate consciousness, given that neuroscience describes the brain in

148

terms of the macroscopic matter made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other atoms, the
relationships of which can be described without either requiring or generating consciousness.
The failure to find a theory with satisfactory explanatory power within classical physics
pushes us towards identifying consciousness as a fundamental or given property of the
universe. What does this really mean? Explanation in science works by breaking things down
into their components and the forces or processes that make them function. But this
downward arrow of explanation does reach a floor. Mass, charge, spin and the particular
strengths of the forces of nature are given properties of the universe that are not reducible to
anything else and come without any explanation. Because consciousness has a similar lack of
explanation, it is similarly suggested to be a fundamental property.
Although the powers of understanding of human senses and the scope of Newtonian science
are limited to three spatial dimensions, the scope of our universe is not limited to three
dimensions. In fact, news theories hypothesize there are eleven dimensions. Many of the
natural phenomena happening within our universe transcend the three dimension scene.
Therefore, it is not possible to assume that the mechanisms of operation of the brain and
consciousness remain imprisoned within the confines of Isaac Newton’s three dimensional
material universe. Just as the Earth was proved not to be the center of the universe, our current
theories that govern our physical universe such as Einstein’s gravity theory and others may
become obsolete in our understanding of reality.
It is reasonable to consider properties of the brain correlated with consciousness, but it is not
possible at this stage to shut the possibility that, as Nobel Laureate Neurobiologist Sir John
Eccles points out, the scope of consciousness may not remain limited within the confines of the
human skull. This is especially so because many of our practical observations and those of
many others clearly show that consciousness, at times, can remain completely des-embodied.
We can hence, focus our attention on understanding three factors, the nature of consciousness,
the property of the brain that enables consciousness to operate within the brain, and a model
that explains the behavior of the brain and consciousness as practically observed.
The slow electrical pulses moving at a maximum speed of 120 mps may, perhaps, be adequate
to account for some of the involuntary functions inside the human body. But they are certainly
not adequate to account for the speed of human activities that involve computing and the
mind. The similarities between the computer circuits and the brain cells have driven brain
researchers to construct computer models for the brain. Initially, they tried serial computers,
and then to account for the speed, parallel computers came into play. Today, computer models
dominate most brain research, but are still no match for the human brain.

149

However, computer models are many orders of magnitude slower than needed to account for
the speed of thought. A Neurologist has calculated that if the brain was a standard serial or a
parallel computer, it would take more time than the age of the universe to perform all the
necessary calculations associated with just one perceptual event. But if the brain were a
quantum computer, it would try out all the various possible combinations of data
arrangement at once, and thus, unify its experience. So, in essence, the brain operates very
similar to how science theorizes a quantum computer to work even though quantum
computers do not yet exist.
Many who research on the brain-mind problem proceed with a prior assumption that
consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, but quantum physics indicates that
consciousness is related to the awareness that an electron appears to show in the
wave/particle duality (double slit experiment). Quantum physicists have shown that the
electron behaves differently when being observed by a human.
When the electron is not being observed, the electron behaves like a wave, but when an
observing instrument is placed in the experiment, the electron behaves like a particle. This
experience indicates that the electron will change its behavior/reality depending on whether
or not the electron is being observed as if the electron is aware that it is being observed. This
awareness is very similar, if not the same, as human awareness and may be related to the same
consciousness.
Consciousness is, therefore, a non-material entity capable of independent, eternal existence,
and not a property. Consciousness is not emergent, and is eternal similar to the electron. It can
remain localized in the human brain and interact with the brain, and thereby, control the
activities of the human body. While electrons in the brain behave as particles, these electrons
prevent the consciousness from realizing that it is part of a larger whole. When the electrons
behave as a wave, the consciousness becomes aware of its existence outside the human mind,
which makes OBE and NDE possible.
Whenever the electron wave function collapses, the OBE and NDE ends and the person
returns to their physical body and its perception of reality similar to the collapsing of the wave
function in the double slit experiment in quantum physics. During the OBE and NDE while
the electron is behaving as a wave function, consciousness can leave the brain and go into an
independent floating existence outside the human body where it can travel independent of
space-time similar to the entangled electron.
Consciousness is, therefore, a non-material entity capable of independent, eternal existence,
and not a property. Consciousness is not emergent, and is eternal similar to the electron. It can
remain localized in the human brain and interact with the brain, and thereby, control the
150

activities of the human body. While electrons in the brain behave as particles, these electrons
prevent the consciousness from realizing that it is part of a larger whole. When the electrons
behave as a wave, the consciousness becomes aware of its existence outside the human mind,
which makes OBE and NDE possible.
Whenever the electron wave function collapses, the OBE and NDE ends and the person
returns to their physical body and its perception of reality similar to the collapsing of the wave
function in the double slit experiment in quantum physics. During the OBE and NDE while
the electron is behaving as a wave function, consciousness can leave the brain and go into an
independent floating existence outside the human body where it can travel independent of
space-time similar to the entangled electron.
It has been shown using such techniques as PET and MRI that the above process of receiving
data from a stimulus by a sensory organ, transmitting them to the brain, computing and
processing the data, and passing the processed data to consciousness, can be reversed by
hypnotizing a person. When a hypnotherapist suggests, for example, that he/she is seeing red
light to a hypnotized subject, all above processes take place in the brain as if the subject is
actually seeing red light. The consciousness gives the brain a perception of reality that is
different from the hypnotherapist’s perception of reality similarly to an observer in the
example of general relativity where one observer on Earth watches another travel away at the
speed of light. To the traveling observer, his perception of reality is different than the observer
watching from Earth, and as a result, his experience of time is different than the observer on
Earth.
The ability of a person to describe what his/her consciousness had observed or heard while it
is in a des-embodied state makes us to believe that memory is, at least partly, non-material and
unaffected by collapsing the wave function. Quantum systems are essentially unified, and so
are our thought processes. David Bohm says, “Thought processes and quantum systems are
analogous in that they cannot be analyzed too much in terms of distinct elements, because the
intrinsic nature of each element is not a property existing separately from and independently
of other elements, but is instead a property that arises partially from its relation with other
elements.”
We can conclude that consciousness is a quantum mechanical entity that can have an
independent existence. It can localize in the human brain when the electron is in a particle
state. This provides the necessary quantum mechanical base conducive for it to interact with
and function in the brain. When the state changes to that of a wave, consciousness takes flight
and starts floating. It takes away with it at least a part of the contents of the memory. It
possesses the ability to acquire visual, auditory and olfactory information in spite of the fact
that there are no sense organs associated with it. This information is produced by the
151

consciousness projection of a different reality caused by the change in state of the electron,
which one may interpret later as a dream or hallucination that comes from an altered
perception of reality.
The major stumbling block in solving the brain-mind problem is how does the brain-mind
bind together millions of dissimilar neuron activities into an experience of a perceptual whole.
How does the “I” or “self” or the perceived wholeness of one’s world emerge from a system
consisting of so many parts, billions of neurons. What creates the “Oneness” of thought
processes? What creates individuality and I-ness or “self”? What creates feelings, free will, and
creativity? The eternal consciousness.
No mechanistic system consisting of separate interacting parts could give rise to the above.
What are the structures in the brain that create the property which grant us access to the
quantum realm? This is a good question and once this is known by all mankind, mankind will
change. It has become clear that to explain this theory, one has to consider the most highly
ordered and highly unified structures possible in the universe. The structure that possesses
both characters, the most highly ordered and most highly unified is the Bose-Einstein
condensate.
In classical science, the most ordered structure that we can find is the crystal. Crystals are
rigid, immovable structures. In Bose-Einstein condensates, the quantum properties allow both
a “fluid” order and a high degree of unity. Each particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate fills all
the space and all the time in whatever container that holds the condensate. Many of their
characteristics are correlated. They behave holistically as one. The condensate acts as one
single particle. There is no “noise” or interference between separate parts. This is why super
fluids and super conductors have their special frictionless qualities and lasers become so
coherent. Super conductors, super fluids, and lasers are Bose-Einstein condensates. The
photons of a laser beam overlap their boundaries and behave as one single photon and the
whole system can be described by a single equation. Hence, the part always includes the
whole like in fractal geometry.
Super conductors, super fluids, and lasers are either very low temperature or very high energy
systems. Super conductors and super fluids loose their quantum coherence long before they
reach room temperature. Quantum coherence at body temperature in body cells was found by
Herbert Frohlich. Prior to that, quantum physicist Fritz Popp discovered that biological tissue
emits a weak glow when stimulated at the right energy levels.

152

Fig. 50: The mind pictured as an integral part of the quantum realm (a) in which entanglement
plays a crucial role (a), illustrated by the coherent entanglement of the magnetic interaction of
two electrons (b).
Cell walls of biological tissue contain countless proteins and fat molecules which are electrical
dipoles. When a cell is at rest, these dipoles are out of phase and arrange themselves in a
haphazard way. But when they are stimulated they begin to oscillate or jiggle intensely and
broadcast a tiny microwave signal. Frolich found that when the energy flowing through the
cell reaches a certain critical level, all the cell wall molecular dipoles line up and come into
phase. They oscillate in unison as though they are suddenly coordinated. This emergent
quantum field is a Bose-Einstein condensate and has holistic properties common to any
quantum field (Fig.50). Consciousness may work in a similar matter.
Zohar, 1990 suggests that ion channel oscillations in neurons are quantum phenomena which
generate a Frolich like coherent electric field. There are ion channels (protein molecules) lining
the membrane walls of individual neurons, which open or close in response to electrical
fluctuations resulting from stimulation. They act like gates to let Sodium, Potassium, and other
ions pass through. They are of a size to be subject to quantum fluctuations and superposition.
Each channel, as it oscillates, generates a tiny electric field. When a large number of ion
channels (there are 10 million in each neuron) open and close in unison, as they do when
stimulated, the whole neuron fires or oscillates and a large scale electric field is generated
across the neuron. Certain neurons act as pace makers. When a pacemaker neuron oscillates in
response to stimulation, whole bundles of neurons oscillate with it. A finding by a
neurobiologist that when a person sees an object, all neurons in the Cerebral Cortex, associated
153

with that perceptual object, oscillates in unison regardless of their location in the brain. These
neurons behave similar to entangled electrons.
Zohar implies that the original ion channel oscillations are quantum phenomena; which, as in
Frolich systems, generates a coherent quantum electric field. It is a Bose-Einstein condensate.
Existence of such large scale coherent electrical fields across the brain explains how a large
number of disparate and distant neurons can integrate their information to produce a holistic
picture, hologram. The quantum entanglement proof that has been developed fairly recently
says that non-local (instantaneous or faster than light) quantum correlations exists between
particles apparently separated in space and time has helped scientists to understand these
effects. Quantum entanglement, also called the quantum non-local connection, is a property of
a quantum mechanical state of a system of two or more objects in which the quantum states of
the constituting objects are linked together so that one object can no longer be adequately
described without full mention of its counterpart—even if the individual objects are spatially
separated in a space-like manner.
The crucial distinguishing feature of Bose-Einstein condensate is that many parts which go to
make up the ordered system not only behave as a whole, but they become whole. There
identities merge and overlap in such a way that they lose their individuality entirely. This is a
quantum property. Such a large quantum synchronicity exists in and accounts for the special
properties of lasers, super conductors, and super fluids. Only this type of quantum correlated
condensed state could explain the unbroken wholeness of the thought process. Consciousness
behaves as a fractal. This is similar to a hologram where small fractal parts are identical to the
whole part.
The property of the brain which is the non-local quantum correlate or the Bose-Einstein
condensate behaves as above. It creates a unity from the diverse bits of information drawing
them to a meaningful whole. The millions of sensory data from sense organs received every
moment are channeled to various disparate areas of the brain and processed by the computing
facility of the brain. Consciousness receives this processed information and creates a holistic
scene, hologram. It is this integration of all the processed bits of information to create a one
whole that creates the identity as a person, the self or the I-ness. Here is the coherent non-local
quantum correlation of the brain and it is an emergent property.
Consciousness is a non-material entity in the quantum domain that is capable of independent
existence. Consciousness can remain localized in the brain so long as the emergent quantum
particle state does not change, just as an electron which is a quantum entity can remain
localized in an atom so long as the energy of the electron matches the quantum state it
occupies.

154

Fig. 50: An overview of PSI phenomena, transpersonal experiences and related conscious
states.
Whenever the property breaks down, the mathematical function that governs the behavior of
quantum particles changes, i.e. the electrons changes its behavior from that of a particle to a
wave function. When this happens in the brain, consciousness can leave the brain and take up
a floating existence in the way an electron leaves its atom if it acquires excess energy and starts
a floating existence as a free electron. Consciousness can return to the brain if the property is
re-established and the wave function collapses and the particle function prevails.
This model may explain all the observed properties of human consciousness including Psiphenomena, NDE, OBE and reincarnation (Fig.51). Since all information transfer in a non-local
quantum correlation is instantaneous, just like the speed of an electron and light is
instantaneous, it explains the speed of human action. It can be extended to explain phenomena
such as telepathy and also explains the individual identity, or the I-ness or self.
This is only a start. In itself it tells us nothing about how such a fundamental manifests in the
brain. Rather than having a solution, we are only at the beginning of a very difficult journey
towards something with explanatory value. Not only do we have to discover some system that
is truly fundamental, but, given the lack of apparent consciousness in the rest of the universe,
we need a process that is unique in operating only in brains, and not in other physical systems.

155

Quantum consciousness is really a misnomer for the sort of system that we are looking for.
The philosopher, David Chalmers, 2000 was correct in pointing out that there was no more
reason for consciousness to arise from quanta than there was for it to arise from classical
structures. Both permeate the universe outside of the brain without producing consciousness.
The quanta and their behavior are only of interest if they can allow the brain access to a
fundamental property not apparent in other matter.
This brings us also to the question of what really is fundamental. There are two sides to this
question. The quanta and spacetime. The quanta are the fundamental particles/waves of
energy, which also equates to the mass of physical objects. Some quanta such as the proton
and the neutron are composed of other quanta, so are not truly fundamental or elementary.
The quarks that make up the protons and neutrons of the nucleus of the atom and the force
carrying particles such as photons appear to be the most fundamental quanta. But the quanta
cannot be understood in isolation. They must be seen as having some form of relationship to
spacetime, and that’s a more difficult area than might appear at first sight.
Neither quantum theory, nor relativity which is our theory of spacetime, have ever been
falsified, but they are, nevertheless, incompatible with one another. Many physicists are
coming round to the notion that spacetime is not an abstraction but a real thing, and also
something that is not continuous, but discrete, and perhaps best conceived in the form of a
web or network. They are divided as to whether the quanta create spacetime, or spacetime
generates the quanta, or the third possibility that the two are expressions of something more
fundamental. However, whatever form it is conceived to take, the concept of a real and
discrete structure also allows the possibility of some form of pattern or information capable of
decision making, and this is the level of the universe where we need to look for an explanation
of consciousness..
There are two routes leading to the conclusion that consciousness has to derive from such a
fundamental level of the universe. In addition to the view that classical physics simply can’t
cut it in respect of consciousness, there is the Penrose approach via the function of
consciousness. As described earlier, he proposed that the Gödel theorem meant that human
understanding or conscious could perform tasks that no algorithm-based system such as a
computer could perform. This is led to an arcane dispute with logicians and philosophers
which few lay people can follow.
Individual consciousness is therefore considered as an expression of an underlying non-local
quantum field, which exhibits holographic properties. It is postulated that the human brain is
interfacing this universal information field, to our individual consciousness. This universal
information domain may be physically identified as the zero-point-energy field. The
interfacing brain may also explain the phenomena of binding, qualia, intuition, serendipity,
156

extra-sensory perception and some well established Psi-phenomena. It is stipulated that
universal consciousness did also contain the recipe for biological evolution (Fig. 52), and that it
was instrumental in the evolutionary creation of conscious observers.

Fig. 52: Potential quantum mechanisms in the evolution to first life
However, it may be unnecessary to penetrate into such an arcane area. At a much more
mundane level, the process of choosing between alternative forms of behavior or courses of
action by means of subjective scenarios of the future looks to also invoke a process that cannot
be decided by algorithms. This suggestion is now supported by recent studies showing that in
the orbitofrontal region the brain some activity correlates to subjective appreciation rather
than the strength of signal, whereas in other parts of the brain not involved with preferences,
activity correlates to the strength of this same signal. So while Penrose provides the original
inspiration for the idea of an aspect of the universe that could not be derived from a system of
calculations, it seems possible to simplify or streamline the original inspiration in a manner
that is compatible with recent brain research and not open to the same sort of attacks from
logicians and philosophers.
In a similar way, it may be possible to simplify Penrose’s proposal of a special type of
quantum wave function collapse as the gateway to conscious understanding, seen here as an
aspect of fundamental spacetime geometry. Penrose dismissed the randomness of the
conventional wave function collapse as irrelevant to the mathematical understanding in which
157

he was initially interested, and instead proposed a special form of objective wave function
collapse, which was neither random nor deterministic, but accessed the fundamental
spacetime geometry. His proposal as to wave function collapse is currently the subject of
experimental testing although this is a procedure that is likely to take up to a decade.
Again the question is whether it is necessary to go to such lengths. Might there be a way
around the apparent randomness that led Penrose do dismiss conventional wave function
collapse. Might not the more conventional wave function collapse, or alternatively
decoherence equally well provide an access to the fundamental and conscious level of the
universe. There are queries as to how random the randomness is. In one form of the famous
two slit experiment, single photons arrive at a screen over some extended period of time. The
initial photons register on the screen in apparently random position, but as later photons
arrive the familiar light and dark bands form. Somehow later photons or perhaps the earlier
photons, ‘know’ where to put themselves. There is a suggestion that this puzzle links to one of
the other puzzles of quantum theory, namely entanglement, by which the quantum properties
of particles can be altered instantaneously over any distance. In this suggestion, the photons in
the two slit experiment are entangled with other distant quanta. Whatever it is that decides the
position of these particles in this scheme has no apparent explanation in terms of algorithms or
systems of rules for calculating, and this is something that it holds in common with choice by
emotional valuation.
But how could such a mechanism related to the fundamentals of distant space arise within our
brains. Penrose’s collaborator, Stuart Hameroff, proposed a scheme by which quantum
coherence arose within individual neurons and then spread throughout neuronal assemblies.
Most conscious commentators believe that this theory can be straightforwardly refuted
because of the rapid time to collapse or decoherence for quantum states in the conditions of
the brain. However, this simplistic approach has in effect been partly refuted by the discovery
of functional quantum coherence in biological systems during the last few years, initially in
simple organisms subsisting at low temperatures, but most recently at room temperature and
in multicellular organisms. Moreover, it is now apparent that the structures of aromatic
molecules within the amino acids of individual neurons are similar to those within
photosynthetic organisms now known to use quantum coherence. The structures that support
quantum states in photosynthetic systems rely on the pi electron clouds discussed in earlier
sections and in microtubules the amino acid tryptophan supports the same structure of pi
electron clouds which thus look potentially capable of sustaining quantum coherence and
entanglement through significant sections of a neuron. The mechanisms by which quantum
coherence could subsist in neurons looks here to be within our grasp or understanding.
But as with the original Penrose proposal, Hameroff’s scheme may be more ambitious and
therefore more open to criticism than it needs to be. Where quantum states have been shown
158

to be functional they subsist for only femtoseconds or picoseconds, whereas the Hameroff
scheme requires quantum coherence to be sustained for an ambitious 25 ms, moreover it has to
be sustained over possibly billions of neurons spread across the brain. This lays it open to
attack from many angles.
It looks much more feasible to work from the basis of quantum coherence that exists in other
biological systems and to look for similar short lived single cell processes in the brain. The
known systems of functional quantum states that subsist within individual cells elsewhere in
biology look to have the potential to exist within neurons. For this reason, it is thus much more
feasible in the absence of countervailing evidence to work on the basis of consciousness arising
within individual neurons. This effectively inverts the Hameroff scheme. Rather than neurons
feeding into the global gamma synchrony, the synchrony, which is certainly correlated with
consciousness, may be a trigger to conscious activity in neurons.
Some studies give credibility to the idea of consciousness in single neurons (Edwards, 2005,
Sevush, 2006). In addition, experimentation has shown that increased activation in single
neurons is correlated to particular percepts. Some neurons are selective in only responding to
particular images, and activity in these is correlated to the conscious experience of those
images. Of course it isn’t as simple as that. With 100 bn neurons in the brain, and perhaps a
good percentage of these selecting for particular images, there has to be some way of
coordinating their activity.
It is initially puzzling that the same type of experiments that show a correlation between
consciousness and individual neurons, also show a correlation between the global gamma
synchrony and consciousness. So which of these produces consciousness, the individual
neurons or the gamma synchrony? Recent studies suggest that activity in individual neurons
correlates with the gamma synchrony when a number of the neuron’s neighbors were also
active. This agrees with studies showing ‘hot spots’ of activity in the brain also correlated with
consciousness. Here we are perhaps left with the concept that the brain is a gate to the
fundamental level of the universe, in the literal sense of a mechanism that allows or prevents
entry. All of this may seem very speculative, but against this has to be set the lack of
explanation in classical physics for the ‘something it is like’ or the ability to have choice or
preference that we find in consciousness.
