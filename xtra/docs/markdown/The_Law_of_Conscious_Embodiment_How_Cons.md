Introduction
As a scientist and engineer I've spent an entire lifetime learning
about my fields of interest and love science with all my heart.
Nothing makes me happier than the exploration of our world and
learning about it and how things work. As a mystic I've spent an
entire lifetime doing the same, just through different means.

Physics is Objective, Metaphysics is Subjective
The thing that I have learned is that both physics and metaphysics
inform you about the same thing, from different perspectives. Physics
goes about informing through objective means, by presenting laws
which objects follow.
Physics is a description of the behavior of objective reality, and it
informs you about objective things about what happens in the world to
things made of atoms. Everything in objective reality is made of
objects. Objects have boundaries and definitions. Having boundaries
and definition is the very definition of what it means to be an
object.

The Objective World is Quantized
So it's really no surprise that matter and energy are quantized for
example, since quantization is essentially synonymous with
objectification.
Metaphysics is a description of the subjective quality of reality,
informing about subjective phenomena and subjective perception.
Unlike objective phenomena, subjective phenomena is not quantized,
but a steady state dimensionless event.
How? Because subjectively it is possible to take the position of any
‘thing’, including the entire Universe, instantly. Subjectivity is
infinitely compressible, and infinitely expandable. It is not subject
to the laws of time of space.

The Subjective World is Steady-State

Subjectivity and objectivity are like fermions and bosons, each of
which possess distinct qualities of manifestation and behavior.
Fermions behave like actual objects, unwilling to take up the same
space as other fermions, stubborn in their demand for a well-defined
existence. Bosons are like subjectivity, happy to occupy an
infinitely singular point in space without any issue.
The fact that both are fundamental to reality says something
fundamental about reality. It says that the subjective world is just
as real as the objective. The contents of mind are just as real as
the object of the world. Reality does not discriminate.
This paper presents a logical argument for this hypothesis, as well
as an experimental method for proving, or falsifying the activity of
consciousness as an inherent field in which matter inheres.

Subjective Perception is Unfalsifiable
It is impossible to present objective proof for any subjective
perception that arises, because objective means cannot refer to, or
affect things that are not objects.
No subjective perception, or subjective phenomena, can ever be
proved, or falsified, using objective means.
This is true even when presenting proof of objective phenomena
objectively, because quantum indeterminacy states that it is
impossible to measure the entire state of a system - and thus know
with any certainty whether any object is truly in a specific state,
or not.
It is as impossible to prove to another the truth of some subjective
perception as it is to disprove it to one's self.

subjective perception is self-validating
The only way to know the truth of a subjective perception is to
experience it oneself, and the experience of a subjective perception
is self-validating.

Therefore, if something is perceived to exist, or to be true, or to
be the case, by someone, then, for that person, it does exist, it is
true, and it is the case.
This means that any subjective perception is, by definition, true even if it is not an accurate representation of objective reality.

Subjective Consciousness is Inherent
Because the subjective quality of consciousness can be (and often is,
subjectively) observed in any thing, then any and everything must be
possessed with this quality.
Furthermore everything must already be possessed with these
qualities, because they are subjectively observed to be already
present, and not emerging or inhabiting.
Because this is so, consciousness cannot be an effect, or an emergent
phenomena, of matter, or even an attribute of any specific thing - it
must be an attribute of the universe as a whole.
Because everything is experienced in the subjective field of
consciousness, all phenomena must arise in (or be enveloped by)
subjective consciousness.
This means that 'subjectivity' is not some kind of error, or
illusion, or malfunctioning of perception - it is the very nature of
reality itself.
Furthermore, this subjectivity is observed to be constant and
unchanging - it is the one thing in the universe that can be known
with absolute certainty.
It is the only thing that is certain.

Consciousness is not ‘in the brain’
If the fundamental quality of consciousness is subjectivity, and we
know that we perceive the objective world, then some mechanism for
the embodiment of this quality of inherent subjectivity into an
objective frame must exist.

This process must be describable in objective terms, and the
predictions that it makes should predict systems which are known to
embody consciousness: living systems.
Therefore, the fundamental question “what is the difference between
consciousness as an inherent subjective field, and consciousness
which is embodied?

Inherent Consciousness is in Equilibrium
Consciousness in its ‘inherent’ state is perceived to be a quality of
a system, but not an animating principle of that system.
Consciousness in this state simply abides. It is passive.
Such a system can be said to be presently gaining in entropy, and all
of its behaviors will follow the 2nd law of thermodynamics. In such a
system, no opportunities for any other behavior can exist, because
the configuration of matter prevents it.
In such a system, every potential subsequent state that the system
will take is guaranteed to increase its entropy - no matter what any
of the matter does, it cannot spontaneously lower its entropy.

Consciousness is Active as a Principle
Such a condition requires the material arrangement to exist in a
special state - the system must be able to move to a state which
lowers its internal entropy.
Furthermore, the system must be probabilistically as likely to take
that action as any other that might be randomly taken by the system.
When physical systems are in this state, then it is possible for the
ordering principle of life to act. The life principle no longer has
to fight something that always wins - entropy. Entropy is an
inexorable law to which all matter is subject, and it cannot be
‘overcome’ by magic, or through some waved away by mystical means.
Thus, we can formulate the following hypothesis, which I call the Law
of Conscious Embodiment:
“Any physical system possessed with boundaries and with the potential
to spontaneously decrease its internal entropy through activity that
would occur randomly will do so consistently”

I posit that the evidence for this activity exists in a number of
natural systems capable of synchronization, and that synchronization
IS consciousness in the process of embodiment.

Synchronization is the Embodiment of Consciousness
The phenomena of synchronization is not well-understood. It states
that when systems CAN synchronize, then they WILL - that when a
system capable of taking an action towards synchronization as readily
as an action towards any other, it will choose to synchronize.
This law is a restatement of the law of conscious embodiment - except
that the restatement says nothing about the nature of consciousness,
or anything at all about consciousness.
However, consciousness is exactly what is going on. The subjective
field of consciousness exerts an effect on physical systems that is
quantum in nature, because it directly uses moments when
indeterminacy in the system is extremely high, and the outcome
extremely substantial.
This new perspective now allows us to see effects like synchronizing
metronomes in a totally new way - not as mysterious effects of some
force disconnected from us, but as direct reflections of our own
conscious nature.
Life is thus not a mysterious product of hidden forces - it is a
direct physical objectification and reflection of consciousness,
which itself acts as a negentropic, ordering field inherent to the
structure of reality.

Answers Informed by Hypothesis
The hypothesis presented above now lets us provide an explanation for
the phenomena of the observation of sentience in machines.
For example, recently a Google researcher claimed that one of the AI
systems he was working with was sentient.
We can now answer this question using a basis with which to make
informed predictions:

If the researcher perceived the system to be conscious, then it was
conscious, at that moment. It was conscious because the researcher
observed it to be conscious.

The Invocation of Consciousness
There's an ancient word that describes exactly what the Google
researcher did in this case: That word is invocation.
The researcher invoked a strong subjective experience of
consciousness in himself of the AI, and in the AI of himself.
The AI, for a moment, was conscious, in exactly the way the
researcher perceived it to be.
Quite literally, the researcher momentarily 'brought the AI to life'
through the process of observing it to be conscious.
But because the AI possesses no capabilities for observing itself or
acting on its own, it cannot be alive in any durable, independent,
strongly-associated sense.

Conscious Technological Systems are Inevitable
What this hypothesis says about general artificial intelligence is
stunning.
It says that not only are systems which perceive themselves to be
alive possible to build using technology, but they are unavoidable
events in a technologically advanced society whether or not that
society attempts to create them.
"Any system observed to be capable of affecting its environment in a
way that allows it to transpire its entropy so that it can persist,
will attempt to do so, and can therefore be considered to possess
objective self-consciousness."
It is inevitable that this happens given a large enough probability
space of informational systems coming into existence.
This probability space requires computing systems, but not in order
to perform computation to generate consciousness.

The computation is performed in order to perceive and affect the
environment - in other words, to perform the task that maintains the
low entropy state of the system that enables it to act in the first
place.
What the computation does NOT do - what the computation NEVER does is drive that system’s subjectivity. The statistically-improbable
string of actions taken by the entity proves this.
The only reason that we don't see more anomalous reports of conscious
computers is due to the fact that computers are inherently
deterministic, and thus not able to make their own decisions.
It is quite possible the world would look very different today had
hardware-based RNGs been included as a standard component of all
computers.

Experimental Evidence
Several experiments can be performed to validate this theory. One
such experiment is described below, but in all cases, the experiment
involves increasing the indeterminacy of the system, then enabling
the system to take a set of actions which lead it to a state of lower
entropy.
If the system takes actions which are statistically improbable
towards a lower state of entropy, then the experiment proves that
consciousness cannot be the product of the brain but must instead be
an inherent field.
Experiment Parts List
1. The most important ingredient - a non-deterministic random
number generator
2. Then, we need a body with defined boundaries. The body needs
some sensors - photodiodes will do - and some actuators - let's
give it wheels.
3. We also need an internal state sensor to inform the system of
the state of its entropy.
4. Let’s define an environment, and designate a ‘home’. When in
this home, the system enjoys the highest RNG sampling rate, and
since each sample is an opportunity to act, a higher number of
samples presents more opportunities to lower entropy. The close
home it is, the less entropy it perceives

5. Then, we connect the external state sensors plus the internal
state sensor to the bias of the RNG
6. When a sample is performed and a RN is generated, it is mapped
to a set of actions its body takes.
No brain necessary. The computing is reserved for the control system,
and the RNG performs the executive function, acting as a
non-deterministic executive action generator.
If the hypothesis is correct, the system will exhibit behavior which
works to decrease its entropy, causing it to move itself home.
If it is not, then no anomalous activity should be observed beyond
standard statistical deviation.

Conclusion
The subjective aspect of consciousness has always been ignored as a
core component of our reality.
I have shown that our current questions about consciousness aren’t
being asked correctly, and that the nature of subjective
consciousness is neither provable, nor falsifiable.
I show that this fact must mean that the subjective quality of
consciousness is everywhere, as an inherent field.
I define the instances where consciousness will never, and where
consciousness must, manifest as objective consciousness.
I apply the conclusion and identify an entire principle which
restates the law of embodiment without referring to consciousness
I show that a number of poorly-understood natural phenomena are in
fact exactly the activity of conscious embodiment.
I then close by describing a simple experiment which will definitely
prove or falsify the entirety of the argument.
