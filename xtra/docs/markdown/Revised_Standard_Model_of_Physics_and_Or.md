Revised Standard Model of Physics and Origin of Biology

Abstract: We study with a new conception beyond the standard model physics and about the
formation of biological molecules/atoms. Our physical universe appeared by a continuous symmetry
breaking of the new energy sources from „Big Rip‟ Singularity[i.e. when space-time(here we
consider the square of the Einstein‟s real space & time of the physical unfolded universe i.e., -R 2 )is
infinity in another phase] to the “Super Unified Gaussian Energy Group SU(11)”(that means
considering the Revised Standard Model of Physics) then GUT the “Unified Gaussian Energy Group
SU(5)”[i.e., the present Standard Model of Physics], i.e. in a “Particular Physical Universe”
(called a narrower universe) [there may be created several type of particular “ Physical Universe”
in the ocean(filled with new energy sources explained details in my previous articles) of the wider
universe which infinitely largest].These class of symmetry group starting from Big-Rip singularity where
energy pressure and density exists[it was shown in my article “The Complex Quantum and Classical PseudoTachyonic Universe”, IOSR Journal of Mathematics (IOSR-JM) e-ISSN: 2278-5728,p-ISSN: 2319-765X,
Volume 8, Issue 3 (Sep. - Oct. 2013), PP 15-32 www.iosrjournals.org)] and can be expressed mathematically(by
using lie-algebra) as SU(5)  SU (3)  SU( 2)  U(1); SU(11)  SU (5)  SU( 6)  U(1); SU (23)  SU (12) 
SU (11) U (1); SU (47)  SU(24)  SU (23)  U (1); ...........so on.
Thus we assumed that our physical universe appeared by the continuous phase-like transition creating
several new energies(compared as like Gas-Vapor-Liquid states) and actually unfolded with the
symmetry breaking of the Super Unified Gaussian Energy Group SU(11) [ SU (6)  SU( 5)  U(1)]leaving
with new energy sources SU(6), called latent energy groups as explained details in my previous articles, and
SU(5) [ SU (3)  SU( 2)  U(1)], the Gaussian Unified Energy group (GUT) and the electrodynamics U(1),
which are inevitable arises particles that have the characteristics of a magnetic monopole. Monopoles are
highly stable particles and once created they are not destructible. And so they would survive as relics to the
present epoch.
Again our all experiments and measurements or truths/believes are mainly on the basis of “Standard Model of
Physics” or “General Relativity Theory” that means any calculation or experiments made on the basis of
matter universe(i.e., 4-dimensional universe where so called space-time-matter exists, although it is called real
that means only for a particular purpose that counting for a complete matter body like physical universes,
cluster, galaxies, stars, humans, lives, trees,…etc.) formed by the Unified Gaussian Energy Group SU(5), we
called it‟s a narrower universe i.e., a particular physical universe where expansion and contraction both may
be occurred simultaneously within the speed of light for a particular observer and hence Lorentz
transformation, Time dilation,…..etc. Violations may be occurred when we go beyond the “Standard Model of
Physics” of SU(5) to the “Revised Standard Model of Physics” i.e., SU(11), thus outside the physical universe,
in the case of the “Wider Universe” where the energy particles were found in another phase. We illustrate the
scenario with an example that when water decomposed into Hydrogen and Oxygen, the character of water are
far different from the characters of hydrogen and oxygen.
Again, it was considered that the human brain and its mental aspects are associated with classical
brain physiology and are also part of a quantum physical universe. The human brain conceived as
an interfacing organ that not only produces mind and consciousness but also receives information.
The brain or its parts of the brain are conceived as an interference hologram of incoming data and
already existing data which equivalent to the subject‟s memory.
Thus our consciousness or intelligence is a part of the universal consciousness or intelligence.
The animate and inanimate bodies are developed or expanded in the similar manner. The physical
universe expanded from so called Big-Bang singularity scheduled by the conscious energy groups
SU(12), SU(6),.….etc. but the situations created slowly after the symmetry breaking of SU(23), then
SU(11)……..etc. then by rapidly unfolded matter energies b y the symmetry breaking of the Unified
Gaussian Group SU(5) by exchanging the bosons of the latent energy group of SU(6) into the
bosons of SU(5) in the theory of the Super Unified Gaussian Group SU(11) and then Jk–bosons of
conscious energies SU(6) are therefore tightly binding the quar k-likes particles and then gradually
formed protons-likes, neutron-likes,….etc. quasi-particles having masses may have been five times

that of the usual protons, neutrons,….etc or having much more new unknown particles (which are
very much medical relevance for better and critical treatments) created other than Hadrons,
Hyperons, Nucleons,…etc. of SU(5) and after then those unknown particles may gradually
increasing their strengths like as increasing the atomic numbers of usual matter atoms and hence
we may found heavy bio-molecular living matter atoms etc. and then created multiple bio -molecular
cells combining with nonliving matter atoms. Thus living matters always created by the energies of
the group of SU(6) together with all other atoms/elements/compoun d elements/mainly covalencecompounds….etc. which was formed only after the symmetry breaking of the nonliving matter
energy groups of SU(5) as, encountered in condensed matter physics, e.g., in the description of the
conduction electron sea, excitons, magnons, polarons, polaritons, etc. (Ashcroft & Mermin, 1976).
This is very important in view of the potential importance of quantum effects in biology and in
consciousness where not only are systems of many particles considered, but they function at high
temperatures compared to those typically encountered in quantum physics then so called various
kind of complex living cell bodies.
It should right that the actual real time measurement or calculation counting from the symmetry
breaking of the Super Unified Energy Group SU(11) instead of the symmetry breaking of the
Unified Energy Group (GUT) of SU(5). For lives, the real time was measured in two halves first
from the fertilization by their parents(actual counting of time started) and second from the birth till
to the death, although for our age(time) calculations, we ignore the first half similarly for the real
time calculations of our physical universe we ignore the first half that means from the symmetry
breaking of SU(11)up to the next symmetry breaking of SU(5)[although material substances created
by the Unified Gaussian Group SU(5) by the directions of SU(6) with a suitable situations when it
is possible to create bio-molecules that means all then chemical elements created from hydrogen,
nitrogen, carbon,…etc. and with heavier elements or compound elements created by the quarks
were tightly binding with gluons etc. of SU(5), and thus inanimate particles are then ready for the
creation of the animates particles that means the situation when we consider to produce biological
molecules or other units like single live cell then gradually multiple cells with DNA/RNA pairs,
chromosome pairs,….etc. where most of the organic compounds in which are mainly constructed by
the co-valence compounds or compositions or constituted like polymers which are also tightly
binding by the Jk–bosons(latently)[details of Jk–bosons explained in my previous articles] of SU(6)
and creating strong electromagnetic forces[in theory of SU(11) where the latent energy group of
SU(6) are created so strong forces relatively the weak forces of SU(5)] (that means in comparison
to the chemical elements or compounds elements of atoms/molecules etc. which are constructed by
the quarks binding with gluons ….etc. are weaker than some of the unknown new particles formed
by the quarks-likes binding with Jk–bosons) or creating a strong current SU(6) in the frame-work of
SU(6)  U(1) like the weak force SU(2) created a weak current in the frame-work of SU(2)  U(1) are ready
to dynamical situations within the living matters or cells or lives. Our physical universe expanded
up to Big-Break singularity like by the directional commands with the energy group SU(6)[by
exchanging 30-number of bosons of SU(6) into the 30-number of bosons of SU(5) or vice-versa by
exchanging the J-bosons of SU(11)] created like so called consciousness together with all other leaving
new energy sources SU(12), SU(24),…..etc. Thus we may be assumed that consciousness is not only
in animates but also for inanimate (where quarks are tightly binding by the gluons forming protons,
neutrons, electrons,…. etc. for nonliving matters) for which unfolded in a suitable situations like
earth(where quark-like particles are tightly binding by the Jk–bosons of SU(6) for living matters)
and the created residue unknown new particles other than usual particles (that means as like
protons, neutrons, electrons,…..etc. which are formed by quarks with gluons) are always remained
within the living and nonliving elements or compound elements or covalence compounds or
polymers…..etc. as quantum gravity and everywhere which are called as vacant spaces within our
universe. The above mentioned processes are always occurred continuously in the wider universe
which is infinitely larges with other new energy sources. Hence in quantum theories of
consciousness, it is suggested that consciousness is a fundame ntal property of the universe.
Energies of SU(6) created quantum gravity as well as gravitational forces which are required for
the formation of a complete body with definite shape for living and nonliving matter bodies, like
stars with its planets,…. etc. and living bodies with its parts,…. etc. and then so called vacant
spaces are properly filled with the strong new forces of SU(6) around us and also formed like
living cells with organic and inorganic elements or compounds…. etc. mainly constructed by the
chemical co-valence compounds (carbon based like in earth, another planet may be silicon based
etc., because carbon and silicon belong s to the same group in our periodic table) that means which

are more flexible for creating several angled atomic bonds other than rigid crystal-likes and then it
is bindings with cells may operated more easily than other rigid or crystal solid bodies of
elements/compound elements and hence formed as biological cells by creating with polymerizations
etc. and hence then cell-divisions etc. Within the biological cells SU(6) combining with all other
several elements or compound elements with different ions which are created more different waves
but coherently emerging as a single wave or wave functions. Thus in the bio-molecules/atoms etc.
where all material parts created by the elements/atoms of the Unified Gaussian Energy Group
(GUT) of SU(5) delivering behaviors like intelligence, consciousness, mind, emotions,…. etc. with
the combinations of the new energy sources of SU(6),….etc. and also created an electromagnetic
force or current within the brain cells i.e., microtubules by the latent energy group SU(6) creating
an electromagnetic strong force in the framework of SU(6)  U(1) with producing new unknown
particles in the living mode or nonliving mode.Thus for living bodies through ion channel constituted a
flow of current throughout the body carrying with charges of free electron -likes etc. and also may
be similar for the case in the universe where stars atmosphere like as brain cell……etc.(taking as
centre point) always controlled the whole system for example our solar system etc. The created
amount of material substances by SU(5)changing by the bosons of SU(6) are always fixed for a
particular nonliving/living developing bodies and hence for expansive universe or for its parts of
the system till for the compilation or stable shaped. Similarly, after a certain or fixed time (age)
our living bodies started like contraction. Thus, always maintaining a common system like for
universe /cluster/galaxy/star/planet/animal/…..etc. those are all controlled mainly by the same
energy sources of SU(6), then by others like SU(12),SU(24),..…etc. with the combination of the
strong force SU(3), weak force SU(2), & electrodynamics U(1) of SU(5).

Introduction

There is no consensus yet on how the universe initially came to be, the general assumption is that
perhaps an energetic fluctuation caused the universe to tunnel into the existence from quantum foam. The
question of why the large energy of the universe is in a dark, i.e. not found in practical, the observed vacuum
energy is so small in comparison to the scales of particle physics is known as cosmological constant problem. It
is generally thought to be easier to imagine an unknown mechanism which would set vacuum parameter exactly
to zero and so it can be considered that there exist several unifications from the existing physical universe.
These class of symmetry group can be expressed mathematically as SU(11)  SU (5)  SU( 6)  U(1); SU (23)
 SU (12)  SU (11) U (1); SU (47)  SU(24)  SU (23)  U (1); ...........so on. We can assume SU(5), the
Unified Gaussian Group created our so called nonliving matter elements and together with SU(6), a new type of
energy sources may be called as latent energy group created living matter and also together with all other new
energies SU(12), SU(24),….created conscious elements explained details in my previous articles and with U(1)
created electrodynamics force by the symmetry breaking of the energy groups. The Super Unified Gaussian
Group SU(11) unfolded our physical universe instead of GUT of SU(5) and then emerged our physical universe
with lives.
Source of Background Radiation: In the Super-Unified Theory SU(11), whenever there is a
breakdown of SU(11) [SU(5)  SU(6)  U(1)] in which contain the U(1) group, there inevitable arises
particles that have the characteristics of a magnetic monopole. Monopoles are highly stable particles and once
created they are not destructible. And so they would survive as relics to the present epoch. Hence we conclude
the background radiation are “primordial” have arisen from discrete sources and got a powerful electromagnetic
forces with the energy group SU(6).
Our physical universe actually unfolded with 10-dimensional space-time instead of 4-dimensional
space-time. Real time & space and matter are exists and separately counted from unfolding the distinct physical
universe. Thus our universe and its definite shaped parts or complete lives etc. expanded or developed or
increased by the fixed amounts of matter elements or compounds created (matter-space-time are
calculated/measured as real with respect to a particular physical universe that means it is real from Big-Bang to
Big-Crunch through Big-Break singularity which are separate for distinct physical universe) then contraction
after a certain periods like from Big-Break singularity then till to the another phase (death) after Big-Crunch
singularity. Similar proceedings are reasonable for each cluster/galaxy/star/planet etc for nonliving matters and
as well as for living matters also. For lives i.e. animal/human/tree…..etc there contraction may occurred after
certain period (i.e., age or time) then till to the death after then decomposed and diminished gradually.
However, an amazing physicist furnishes answers to these old and difficult questions only in one book
(there are no other articles or books on these questions published by Sean Carroll)! This incredible

accomplishment indicates the huge difference between Physics and Philosophy or Cognitive (Neuro) science!
The idea is that if you want to solve rapidly some great problems (and reading very few texts on those topics) on
philosophy (of mind) and cognitive (neuro) science, you need to be only physicist! Otherwise, clearly you waste
your time…
Those books dwell at length on matters like "neuronal correlates of consciousness", is fail to present an
actual explanation of the nature of consciousness itself. A deeper understanding of quantum structures may help
to overcome the resistance against quantum theory in the field of brain research and consciousness.
There is an explanatory gap between the material structure of the brain and the mental reality of the
consciousness that cannot be bridged by traditional concepts.
As was pointed out, there is a large amount of experimental and theoretical work addressing important
aspects of the connection between neuro-physiological and psychological data. However, it is usually
maintained that none of them has to do with the so called quantum theory.
A naturalist believes that human behaviour emerges from the complex interplay of the atoms and forces
of SU(5) that make up individual human beings. You can’t discover the properties of the microscopic theory just
from knowing the macroscopic theory. Indeed, emergent theories can be multiply realizable: there can, in
principle, be many distinct microscopic theories that are incompatible with one another but compatible with the
same emergent description. Consciousness is not an illusion, even if we think it is “just” an emergent way of
talking about our atoms each individually obeying the laws of physics. To say that consciousness is real and
fundamental property of the universe we need to understanding something over and above the physical universe
that means beyond our 4-dimensional universe or the standard model of physics i.e., GUT of SU(5), hence we
needs 10-dimensional universe or the “Revised Standard Model of Physics” i.e., of SU(11) and so on as
explained details in my previous articles; it is not only emergent, and also real, just like almost every other thing
we’ve encountered in our lives. We know that protons and neutrons are made out of up quarks and down quarks,
held together by gluons. The quarks and gluons, zipping around at high energies inside the protons and neutrons,
are short-wavelength field vibrations. We don’t need to know anything about them to talk about protons and
neutrons and how they interact with each other. In the present dissertation it is very much required to understand
that a “Revised Standard Model Physics” that means our so called real physical universe are actually appeared
by the symmetry breaking of the Super Unified Gaussian Energy Group of SU(11) instead of Gaussian Energy
Group SU(5), we found latent energy group SU(6), an essential strong new energy sources other than material
unified energy group SU(5) and the electrodynamics U(1). In the theory of SU(11), it is possible to exchange
any of 30(thirty) of the latent energy bosons of SU(6) into any of the 30(thirty) matter energy bosons of SU(5)
or vice-versa by the exchange of the J-bosons of SU(11). Actually quark-likes are tightly binding by the Jk–
bosons of the new energy source SU(6) formed various types unknown new particles/quasi particles that can
formed bio-molecules/bio-atoms etc. and hence constituted bio-molecular cells then created cell division,…. etc.
in the living bodies together with all kinds of other matter elements/chemical compounds which are mainly
formed by the quarks and gluons of the energy of SU(5). There is an effective field theory created by the Jkbosons by the new energy sources of SU(6) actively works within protons and neutrons etc. that are perfectly
worked mechanically and well done appropriately.
The invention of all the modern techniques for experimental studies of the living brain required
quantum theory, such as NMR scanners or the comprehensive computer-based data processing. That, of course,
is only a secondary aspect. Much more important is that all biochemical processes are based on the emission and
absorption of bosons. Moreover for systems usually termed “macroscopic”, like nerve cells, the accuracy of
quantum theory may become relevant in instable situations, which are a characteristic of living beings.
Whenever high accuracy is required, quantum phenomena can no longer be ignored. Often, however, it will be
sufficient to deal with the reduced accuracy provided by averaging a great many similar quantum processes.
This may create the misunderstanding that the accuracy of quantum theory is not necessary.
The most important aspect however, is the role attributed to information in this context.
The brain is a place, where permanent feedback processes take place. An action of information is
possible only in instable situations. In theories of non-linear dynamic phenomena, here permanently situations
arise commonly denoted as bifurcation points. At least in such situations, the accuracy of quantum theory can no
longer be ignored. In those situations, meaningful information can act as a steering agent. Such situations are
constantly and ubiquitously encountered in the body. This implies that the material or energetically carriers of
the information are of less importance than the meaningful contents. Here the respective meaning is coded in a
receiver-specific way, being, for example, different for the various types of cells in the body. The decryption of
those codes is a wide and important field of research, directly relevant to human health issues. The meaning of
hard information is strictly to be distinguished from the material or energetic carriers involved in the processing
of information. Many previous concepts resort to magic formulas, such as “emergence” or “functional link”,
which, however, obscure the fact that an actual understanding of the essence of “consciousness” is thereby not
afforded. This applies also to the comprehensive and valuable studies on the correlations between activities in

brain regions and the conscious experience of visual, auditory, and mental impressions. Of course, one can
simply require that “consciousness” is a well-known phenomenon, but obviously the acknowledgment of its
existence does not make obsolete the need for a scientific foundation. ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory)
clarifies key brain processes from which conscious experiences emerge. It predicts a functional link between
processes of Consciousness, Learning, Expectation, Attention, Resonance, and Synchrony (the CLEARS
processes). It is just a step from here to propose that those experiences which can attract our attention and guide
our future lives after being learned are also among the ones that are conscious. Support for the predicted link
between resonance and consciousness comes from many modelling studies wherein the parametric properties of
brain resonances map onto parametric properties of conscious behavioural experiences in the simulated
experiments. Indeed, without such a linking hypothesis between brain mechanisms and behavioural functions,
no theory of consciousness can be fully tested [Grossberg (2013), p. 2, 3].

Wave Function Collapse and Quantum Coherence

Quantum theory is the most fundamental theory of matter known today. The three main levels of
quantum representation are determined by the extent to which the continuous variables of classical physics are
converted to discrete variables, otherwise known as quantization. Newton's equations of motion were replaced
by the Schrodinger (in the non-relativistic case) and Dirac (in the relativistic case) equations governing the time
evolution of the wave functions describing the motion of microscopic objects such as elementary particles. In
the explanation of my theory it is required to choose the Wheeler DeWitt wave equations instead of Schrodinger
wave equations in the case of wider universe as explained. It was shown that the requirement of the
normalizability of the quantum state of the universe, satisfying the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, implies the
disappearance of this quantum state at the Big-Brake singularity. Thus, this result looks as confirming the
hypothesis that in the frame-work of quantum cosmology the singularities can disappear. Similarly the
properties of the solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equations for different cosmological models, connected in
some way with dark-energy hypothesis as the Big-Rip singularity has given analogous result, for well
definiteness of the Hamiltonian by introducing a pseudo-space RI(complex space-time details in my all other
articles namely [“The Complex Model Of The Quantum Universe”, IOSR Journal of Mathematics (IOSR-JM)
ISSN: 2278-5728. Volume 4, Issue 1 (Nov. - Dec. 2012), PP 20-33 www.iosrjournals.org].Quantum field theory
is a second-quantized theory in which all particle properties, field properties and interactions are discrete except
for those due to gravity. Quantum gravity is an incomplete third-quantized theory in which gravity is also made
discrete. In quantum physics, objects possess both a wave aspect and a particle aspect, a view of the physical
world known as the principle of wave-particle duality, or complementarities. The wave function of a particle
describes the probability of ending a particle in a spatial location, thus information about the particle is
described probabilistically rather than deterministically. The superposition forming by the wave functions
implying that quantum particles exist in multiple spatial locations and states simultaneously. When a
measurement is made, one of the multiple states is chosen and the quantum superposition of states ends being
reduced to a classical state in a process known as the collapse of the wave function. Another aspect of quantum
theory is that when two consecutive measurements are made on certain pairs of variables, called complementary
variables, there is a fundamental limitation on the precision of the two measurements. Thus, there is no state in
which both complementary variables can be defined simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. This property is
known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This is a manifestation of the inherent inability to determine
simultaneously the expectation values of two complementary physical observables, for example, angle and
angular momentum, two independent spin components and, perhaps most importantly, energy and time such that
the uncertainties in the two variables satisfy: Et > h=4. While quantum mechanics was developed with
elementary particles in mind by the Gaussian energy group SU(5), its subsequent applications extended its
validity to systems of many particles such as those encountered in condensed matter physics, e.g., in the
description of the conduction electron sea, excitons, magnons, polarons, polaritons, etc. (Ashcroft & Mermin,
1976). This is very important in view of the potential importance of quantum effects in biology and in
consciousness where not only are systems of many particles considered, but they function at high temperatures
compared to those typically encountered in quantum physics the entropy in a given co-moving volume stays
constant in adiabatic expansion. In the entropy was conserved then we would have RT = constant, where R is
the scale factor. The types of quantum many-body systems studied by condensed matter physics exhibit
macroscopic physical properties called collective excitations. A system of many particles under specific
conditions cannot be separated into individual wave functions for each particle rather it is described by a single
wave function describing its collective behaviour when energies of SU(6) created quantum gravity as well as
gravitational forces with some unknown new particle tightly binding by the Jk–bosons which required for the
formation of the collective excitations. This physical property is called quantum coherence and it is
characterized by individual particles losing their separate identities such that the entire system acts as a whole.
Measurements made on one particle cause the collapse of the entire wave function for the system, resulting in an

instantaneous effect for all particles no matter where they are spatially located. Particles that were once unified
in a common quantum state remain physically connected even at a distance. This interaction over distance is
referred to as non-local quantum entanglement.

III.

De-coherence Problem

De-coherence occurs when such a system interacts with its environment in an irreversible
thermodynamic way resulting in different particles in the quantum superposition no longer being able to
interfere with one another. Importantly, the description of solids such as crystals or semi-conductor requires a
proper introduction of energy quantization even at definite temperature T. It can be shown that quantum nature
of solids manifests itself at temperatures up to the characteristic value, TD, called the Debye temperature, which
depends on the size of the solid and its rigidity, which determines the propagation velocity of the sound waves
(phonons). As a consequence of collective behaviour of many-body systems, hallmarks of quantum mechanics
can be seen in the properties of macroscopic objects such as crystals or Ferro-magnets, even above room
temperature. There are also more exotic direct manifestations of quantum behaviour in macroscopic systems
such as superconductors (with no measurable resistance to electrical current and ideal diamagnetism) or super
fluids (with no viscosity and infinite vortices). Functional dependence of properties such as specific heat and
magnetic susceptibility is different in the quantum and classical regimes. However, these latter two examples
have so far been limited to rather low temperatures. Yet a precise location of the boundary (in terms of size and
temperature) between quantum and classical regimes is still under debate. This is why it is required to need an
extensions of quantum mechanics with symmetry breaking from Super Unified Gaussian Energy Group SUT of
SU(11) [ SU (5)  SU( 6)  U(1)] [Revised Standard Model of Physics], where it is possible to create an
electromagnetic forces by SU(6) in the framework of SU( 6)  U(1) and with new unknown particles were
tightly bindings by the latent energy bosons of SU(6) instead of only by the Standard Model of Physics GUT of
SU(5) and an entropy in a given co-moving volume stays constant in the adiabatic expansion, although there we
found a weak neutral current by SU(2) in the framework of SU( 2)  U(1) included biological living matters
with cognitive processes, pose a major challenge. However, it should be kept in mind that Nature has had
millions of years of evolution and immense numbers of replicas of experiments at its disposal to arrive at
solutions to these very difficult problems.
With the examples provided above, we have tried to make a case for the role of quantum effects in
biology. However, there are strong arguments calling for caution in making such claims due to a serious and
fundamental problem involving effects such as coherence, entanglement, superposition, etc. The major issue is
how such systems avoid de-coherence due to environmental interactions, in particular thermal effects at
physiological temperatures. Specifically, thermal noise at such high temperatures (by physical standards) is
expected to lead to de-coherence manifested by the creation of mixed states and an eventual transition to
classical behaviour. Therefore, the main question is how biological systems could find a way to reduce decoherence to allow quantum effects to persist for sufficiently long times to assist in such tasks as quantum
search algorithms or tunnelling phenomena. Quantum de-coherence has been recently the subject of keen
interest of physicists and information scientists working in the area of quantum computation. A quest to build
quantum computers has been underway over the past two decades or so in order to vastly increase the
computational power and speed using coherent quantum states as basic logical units. De-coherence represents a
source of computational error, so the idea is to design architectures that minimize the impact of de-coherence. In
the case of quantum computation de-coherence is a source of error that grows with the temperature of the
environment necessitating the use of extremely low temperatures for quantum computation such as those found
in superconductors or cold atom traps. Therefore, living cells at first glance appear to be a very challenging
system in which to look for quantum effects, since they function at relatively high temperatures, are present in
an aqueous environment and are subjected to thermal and environmental noises. In spite of preliminary
calculations indicating very short de-coherence times in living cells, there are some reasons to believe biological
systems may be not as susceptible to de-coherence as expected. An important aspect which is often overlooked
is that biological systems are highly non-linear, are open to external influences, and operate far from
thermodynamic equilibrium, all these aspects put them in a different category than most physical systems
considered for comparison. It was explained in details in my previous published article [THE COMPLEX
QUANTUM-STATE OF BLACK-HOLE AND THERMOSTATISTICS, IOSR Journal of Mathematics (IOSRJM) e-ISSN: 2278-3008, p-ISSN: 2319-7676. Volume X, Issue X (Sep. – Oct. 2013), PP 01-00,
www.iosrjournals.org], that there exit a flatness of the universe between 10-dimensional universe to 7dimensional universe. Hence there is a link with an extremely fine tuning of the universe to the flat (k = 0)
model. If this tuning was not there, the universe could either have gone into a collapse (k = 1) or an expansion to
infinity (k = -1) in time scales of the order of 10-35s that were characteristic of the GUT era of SU(5).
Now the entropy in a given co-moving volume stays constant in adiabatic expansion. In the entropy
was conserved then we would have RT = constant, where R is the scale factor and in the black-hole problem T =

1019GeV. However, we found that in the flatness problem in this hypothesis led to fine tuning while for the
horizon problem it gave an extremely small size of homogeneity. It therefore appears that the trouble of blackhole lies between 10-dimensional to 7-dimensional flat universe and it could be resolved if the adiabatic
assumption were violated at this stage. So, we conclude that, within the event horizon from 10-dimensional
super-gravity stage, there are mainly two stages, one at the very early stage, were flatness then closed and as
well as rotational stages for black-hole. So, in the late time, we have a symmetry breaking of the energy group
SU(11) [SUT] of the flat universe at 7-dimensional space-time and gave three fundamental energy groups
SU(6), SU(5) and U(1) within the horizon, where U(1) being a charge particle.
The physics of open, non-equilibrium non-linear systems is still poorly understood and many surprising
properties may be discovered including their quantum behaviour. More detailed calculations lead to less
pessimistic results. For instance, Cai.et al. (2010) studied two-spin quantum systems driven from equilibrium
which exhibited coherence even when subjected to thermal noise. Leggett (2002) investigated a spin-boson
model coupled to low-frequency phonons and found extended de-coherence times as well as a mismatch
between the immediate and distant environment effects on the quantum system which would lead to prolonged
coherence at low acoustic frequencies. It is important to stress that biological systems may generally operate at
the classical regime except for some, specifically engineered modes of behaviour that avoid quantum decoherence due to the environment. At least two ways exist through which de-coherence can be diminished for
long enough time periods in order to enable the role of quantum processes in biology. First, a biological
subsystem can be screened or isolated from the de-cohering environment enabling its operation in the quantum
regime. In this connection, thermodynamic gradients may effectively lead to temperature reduction in local
areas such as is the case with the slow release of ATP energy in actomyosin complexes leading to an effective
temperature of only 1:6 103 K. Unlike ordinary laboratory thermodynamic systems, a star is made hotter, not by
adding energy, but by removing it. We consider the change takes place by the latent energy group SU(6) into the
matter energy group of SU(5) of the super unified group SU(11) and vice-versa that means energies of SU(6)
plays fundamental role for the creations of living matters and hence for everything. So, initially heat can be
found from internal energy of the thermo-statistical particles. Second, de-coherence-free spaces may be created
within the Hilbert space where coupling of the system to the environment does not exist. This is a consequence
of the quantum Zeno effect where a paradoxical result is obtained such that strong coupling of some degrees of
freedom to the environment allows other degrees of freedom to produce coherent superposition and persistent
entanglement (Davies, 2004). An example of this effect is a double-well potential in 1D where a particle is
placed in the ground state of one well leading to a repeated tunnelling through the barrier generating specific
oscillations. Placing the particle in an excited state will result in a different frequency of these oscillations.
Creating an initial superposition state of the ground and excited state leads to an evolution of a complicated
combination of oscillating states gradually getting out of phase. Paradoxically, allowing the oscillating particle
to interact with a thermal bath forces the various oscillations into synchrony maintaining partial coherence of the
system as a direct consequence of environmental interactions. Finally, the basic premise that quantum states are
destroyed by increased temperature is of limited validity if one considers the possibility, for example, of laserlike coherent pumping suggested to occur in biological systems with periodic structural arrangements such as
microtubules (Frohlich, 1968). Perhaps more importantly, recent experimental evidence shows that quantum
spin transfer between quantum dots is more efficient at room temperature than at absolute zero (Ouyang &
Awschalom, 2003). The key aspect in these experiments is that the temperature enhanced quantum effect occurs
via a benzene ring, an organic molecule with delocalized electron charge density. Also, experiments have shown
quantum wave behaviour of biological porphyry in molecules (Hackermüller et al., 2003). By analogy, in living
cells de-localizable electrons in aromatic amino acids, for example, may allow proteins to harness thermal
environmental energy to promote, rather than destroy, quantum states. Quantum interactions among tryptophan
in hydrophobic pockets (non-polar, water excluding intra-protein regions) govern protein folding (KleinSeetharaman et al., 2002) and similar effects appear to mediate potassium channel function (Jiang et al., 2003).
Faster time scales may inform processes at slower time scales about rapid processes taking place at a small
spatial level. Finally in this connection, special attention must be paid to the structural hierarchical organization
of biological systems which in turn translates into an interlocking hierarchy of time scales. Amazingly neural
rhythms operate on time scales that vary from milliseconds to seconds, synchronize the forebrain and are
mediated by neurotransmitter systems such as acetylcholine, nor epinephrine, and serotonin (Woolf et al., 2010).
The neurotransmitter systems further fluctuate according to endogenous, circadian rhythms that also fluctuate
according to the season of the year, which ultimately leads to an enormous range of time scales spanning
between 8 and 10 orders of magnitude or even more if atomic fluctuations are included. Since neural events at
the millisecond time scale can affect neural states at the circadian level, by extension it is entirely possible that
quantum states at the ps scale could affect neural activity at the millisecond scale and above. Hence, it is not
necessarily a requirement for MT information processing to avoid de-coherence up to millisecond time scales to
have effects on neural events. It is essential that multiple oscillators be interdependent and sensitive to redundant

patterns. Such interdependence might enable events operating at the shortest time scales and tapping into
quantum mechanisms to affect larger scale events. Once again, coupling between scales and amplification
effects may offer a solution to some of these issues.
IV.
Chemistry to Quantum Biology
Extensions of quantum mechanics to chemical compounds and chemical reactions proved
to be exceedingly successful and an entire field of quantum chemistry was developed as a
consequence. In order to understand the creation of chemical bonds, especially covalent bonds in
which electrons are shared between atoms of a molecule, a quantum mechanical wave function
must be introduced into the formalism. All chemistry including biochemistry is based on the
creation and destruction of bonds between atoms and hence on quantum interactions, so living
systems, like non-living systems, depend on quantum states at the level of chemical bonds. The
same can be said about biochemical reactions taking place in the brain such as ligament binding to
receptors sending signals through neurons. However, these types of quantum physical properties
found in living systems are considered due to the bindings by the Jk–bosons of the new energy
source SU(6). In particular, the unitary oneness and inability of living systems have suggested that
higher level quantum properties such as Bose –Einstein condensation, quantum coherent
superposition, entanglement where explain some of the more enigmatic features of life in general
and consciousness in particular. In the present dissertation we consider the quark-like particles
are tightly binding by the Jk–bosons of the new energy source SU(6) in the theory of Super Unified
Gaussian Group SUT of SU(11) created much more strong new unknown particles may be assumed
as proton-likes, neutron-likes,…etc. much more several characters created bio-molecules like as
hydrogen to heavy atomic numbers elements or compound elements and also created an strong
electromagnetic forces or currents by SU(6) in the frame-work of SU( 6)  U(1) including all other
necessary energy groups SU(12), SU(24),….etc. as explained before may be required for dynamic of the
living bodies to operate in biological systems with consciousness, minds,….etc. creating from single
cell live body to multiple cells bodies by together with quarks of SU(5) are tightly binding by the
gluons of SU(3) formed protons, neutrons, electrons,…etc. of the chemical atoms or molecules and
mainly co-valence compound elements specifically Carbon & Hydrogen based elements ,
Nitrogen,…etc. of the nonliving matters with a weak electromagnetic force created by the weak
force of SU(2) in the frame-work of SU( 2)  U(1).
However, quantum effects are commonly claimed to be washed out at scales larger than
individual atoms or sub-atomic particles, at warm temperatures, and in aqueous media which
provide a noisy environment for parti cle interactions. Thus the likelihood of quantum states
playing functional roles at microscopic or macroscopic scales in warm/ wet and noisy biological
systems seems problematic at face value due to environmental de -coherence effects. As stated
above, it is reasonable to expect that evolution through the process of natural selection over
billions of years of experimentation and countless parallel attempts of trial and error may have
solved the de-coherence problem so that microscopic/macroscopic quantum stat es are essential
features of biological systems. If organized quantum states exist in cells, they are presumably
integrated among their components and organelles by the above mentioned new energy sources
with quasi particles, electromagnetic forces or bosons like as polaritons……etc. Conversely,
collective quantum states of cells may lead to entanglements between cells and coherence over
organs and tissues conducting by those new energy sources explained as above, e.g., the entire
brain or regions of the brain. This brings another important issue to the fore, namely the
hierarchical multi-scale organization of living matter must have a means of not only integrating
information across scale but also an efficient way of altering nois e must be present. Schrodinger's
famous book what is Life? (Schrodinger, 1944), paved the way for the birth of molecular biology in
the 1950s. More than half a century later, the hope that quantum mechanics would eleg antly
explain life processes. So distinctively and comprehensively, has not materialized yet. In spite of
the rapid progress in the use of classical physics methodology to meso -scale systems of relevance
to biology, there have been persistent claims that quantum mechanics can and should play a
fundamental role in biology. For example, biological coherence could emerge through coherent
superposition by the wave function collapsed, tunneling and entanglement. It is very interesting in
the first stage like gaseous state of the universe as explained in my articles remaining the
symmetry of SU(23)[ SU (12)  SU (11) U (1)] the character of the universe are far different from

the second stage when the symmetry breaking of SU(11)[  SU (5)  SU( 6)  U(1)] got three
different energy sources as explained in my articles[The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness,
IOSR Journal of Applied Physics (IOSR-JAP) e-ISSN: 2278-4861.Volume 9, Issue 1 Ver. II (Jan. – Feb. 2017), PP 5793, www.iosrjournals.org].We illustrate the scenario with an example, where the character of water
is far different from the character of hydrogen and oxygen when it is decomposed. Similarly for
our universe in the second phase(that means unfolded from 10-dimensions space-times) it had
been explained that the states of vapor-like phase explained in my articles i.e., from the symmetry
breaking the SUT of SU(11), where quark-likes particles are tightly binding by the plenty of Jk–
bosons in the early stage much created for the requirements of biological molecules [those new
unknown particles are very much medical relevance for better and critical treatments because these
are good or bad lives like many kinds of virus/bacteria,…etc. always created randomly which may
be good/bad for us] or matter atoms,…etc. and thus creating strong electromagnetic forces by
SU(6) in the framework of SU( 6)  U(1), formed living matters together all elements which are
created by the symmetry breaking of the Unified Gaussian Energy Group SU(5), [formed by that of
the strong forces SU(3), weak forces SU(2) & electrodynamics U(1) of the GUT] formed like solid
matter particles hydrogen to heavy particles, after then Jk–bosons always remaining in the form of
latent energy particles, whenever quarks of GUT are binding by the gluons formed proton,
neutrons…..etc. of the matter (solid) atoms/ elements/chemical compound elements, etc]which by
exchanging the bosons of SU(6) into the bosons of SU(5)and then tightly binding between all
elements/covalent compound/polymers……etc . These claims range from plausible ideas like
quantum-assisted protein conformational changes to more speculative suggestions, such as the
genetic code having its origin in quantum computation algorithms, or quantum -mediated cognitive
processing in the brain.
Unfortunately, biological systems are so large and complex compared to standard physical
systems that it is hard to separate or pure quantum effects from a large number of essentially
classical processes that are also present. There is thus plenty of sc ope for disagreement about the
extent to which life in general and cognition in particular utilizes non -trivial quantum processes.
Why should quantum mechanics be relevant to life and consciousness, beyond explaining the basic
structure and interaction of molecules of matter atoms formed by the energy group of SU(5) ? For
one, quantum effects of present can facilitate processes that are either too slow or impossible
according to classical physics or insufficient of quantum physics and thus for explaining biological
system we need to go beyond the present standard model o f physics that means we need a
“Revised Standard Model of Physics” staring from the symmetry breaking of the Super Unified
Gaussian Energy Group SU(11) instead of the Gaussian unified group(GU T) of SU(5). Properties
such as discreteness, quantum tunneling, superposition , wave function collapsed and
entanglement produce novel and unexpected phenomena due to the present conception of the
scientists remained within the GUT model of SU(5). Given that the basic processes of biology take
place at a molecular level, harnessing quantum effects does not seem a priori implausible.
Quantum coherence, collective modes of excitation and condensation phenomena also other
attractive features that could shed light on the mechanisms of robustness and integrity of
biological organisms, especially the amazing power of the human brain.
Since both physics and chemistry crucially depend s on the power of quantum mechanics to
provide fundamental insights into the world around us, it is natural to inquire whether biology
others examples of phenomena where quantum mechanics is the only viable explanation. This is
indeed becoming increasingly clear although examples of quantum effects in biology can so far be
considered only a minor part of life processes as we know them. Below, we provide a brief
overview of the efforts to apply quantum principles to biology.

Excess production of J k bosons in the early universe:

Let us denote the mass of the Jbosons by m J , and its coupling strength by  J . The coupling
strength depending on what type of particle J is of SU(11), let us denoted by c΄ the rate of
collisions that do not conserve the number of J k bosons, i.e. collisions in which the Jboson is
involved. Denote the characteristic decay rate of the J boson by  J , we thus have three time scales

unimportant under the hypothesis of asymptotic freedom. As the universe continued to changing
phase and its constant temperature dropped there was a phase when gravity as well as latent

force become weaker while the other interactions still remained unimportant. Thus for T < 10
GeV, the particles remained essentially free for some time.
During this phase, it becomes necessary to examine the nature of distribution, functions are as
follows. Assuming ideal gas approximation and thermodynamic equilibrium, it is then possible to
write down the distribution functions of any given species of particles. Let us us e the symbol L to
denote typical species (L = 1, 2, 3….). Thus n L (P)dp denotes the number density of species in the
momentum range (P, P + dP), where

typical particle. The quantity μ L is the chemical potential of the species L. We set μ L = 0, g L = 1, m L
= 0, for J k bosons. Since particles and antiparticles annihilate in pairs and produce J k bosons their
chemical potentials are equal and opposite. Again we saw that for T < T J the distribution function

cannot preserve its form under changing phase. Thus it may get distorted from its equilibrium
form. Now of the various species in the very early universe, the J bosons are probably the most
massive. Thus, provided they have a high eno ugh value T J , there is a chance that the J bosons will
first dropout of equilibrium. For this to happen, however, it is also necessary that they have not all
decayed by then. The collision rate  /   J  J . A comparison of the three rates shows that

Brain Functioning and Coherence

Almost a century ago, Gurvitsch introduced the concept of bio -photons and attempted to
elucidate embryology through the action of so -called morphogenic fields, a yet unproven
hypothesis (Beloussov et al., 1997). Following in his footsteps, Popp and his collaborators
demonstrated that photons (bosons), or electromagnetic energy quanta can be both absorbed and
emitted by DNA molecules and this involves low intensity ultraviolet ranges of the spectrum
(Cohen & Popp, 1997). Albrecht-Buehler (1995) demonstrated experimentally that living cells
perceive infrared electromagnetic waves with a peak of their sensitivity close to the wavelength of
1000 nm. He hypothesized the mitochondria, by proton transfer involved in energy production,
release photons. Conversely, centrioles, dubbed by him the eye of the cell, are intricately
structured to absorb these photons and trigger a signaling cascade. Albrecht -Buehler (1995) has
been advocating a theory of cell functioning based on his conviction th at the centriole plays the
key role in orchestrating cellular activities by being both an eye and a brain of the cell. Cell
movement is not random but directed and intentional. This is a crucial characteristic that
distinguishes living from nonliving matter. We assumed that the living matter constructed by the
energy sources of SU(6), SU(3), SU(2), U(1) where SU(6) plying a fundamental role having 35numbers of Jk–bosons out of which 5-bosons are neutral binding with quark-likes particle formed
much more new unknown particles relevance with biological molecules and created a strong
electromagnetic forces with U(1) and similarly other new energy sources like SU(12), SU(24),….etc.
may also created electromagnetic forces together may created like consciousness,
intelligence,…etc. Thus it is not possible to controlled the living cells arbitrarily only by energy
power of SU(6) although it may be created an strong electromagnetic force in the frame -work of
SU( 6)  U(1) maintaining a crucial role for living cells by creating a strong current, as well as also
for non living matter, but non living matter constructed only by the energy sources of strong force
SU(3), weak force SU(2) and electrodynamics U(1) and also created a weak electromagnetic force

in the frame-work of SU( 2)  U(1). Hence an electromagnetic signals coming from the environments
or from outside may be absorbed and emitted by DNA molecules that mean can be react with
living cells and also our consciousness, intelligences….etc. Cells control the movement of every
part of their body. In medical sciences by using the bindings of quark-likes by Jk–bosons producing
with several type of new unknown particles which may be formed valuable medicines with new
elements forming with the proton-likes, neutron-likes,....etc. or an important energy therapy by
creating strong electromagnetic forces or currents with SU(6) in the frame-work of SU( 6)  U(1) for
the prevention(or not any scope to produced from the very beginning of the birth or carriage) of unwanted
cell-divisions like cancer,.......etc. and protected us from critical illness and hence we may got a good healthy
situations for human bodies and other lives. Thus it is very convenient to say about the participation of the
strong neutral currents or electromagnetic forces occurs in the field of Super-Unified Group SU(11) [ SU(6)
 SU(5)  U(1)], i.e. specially in the frame-work SU(6)  U(1), where SU(6) having 35numberbosons, out of which five bosons namely 𝐉𝐊𝟑 , 𝐉𝐊𝟖 , 𝐉𝐊𝟏𝟓 , 𝐉𝐊𝟐𝟒 , 𝐉𝐊𝟑𝟓 , corresponding to the five
diagonal matrices. The strong neutral current created by SU(6) with U(1) are likely to be compared with the
weak neutral current created by the framework of SU(2)  U(1) of the unified group SU(5) [ SU(3)  SU(2) 
U(1)], where SU(2) does not directly involve with electric, it still seems to demand charged bosons
𝐖𝟏 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐖𝟐 . This circumstances prompted efforts to link it with an electromagnetic interaction.
This link achieved via SU(2)  U(1) frame-work originally proposed by A. Salam and S. Weinberg
and sometimes called the electro -weak interaction. The link brings the photon (which is a boson),
closer to three particles 𝐖𝟏 , 𝐖𝟐 & 𝐖𝟑 , where 𝐖𝟏 , 𝐖𝟐 are two opposite charged particles and the
third (𝐖𝟑 ) neutral. In this unified picture it is more convenient to say that another neutral particle
𝐙 𝟎 instead of 𝐖𝟑 , 𝐙 𝟎 has zero mass and charge, just like the photon. However, the photon does not
interact with the neutrino while the 𝐙 𝟎 does. The exchange of 𝐙 𝟎 does not alter electric charge,
and hence such an interaction is called a neutral current interaction. In this we found Hadrons
Hyperons, Nucleons etc. quarks tightly binding with gluons formed proton, neutrons etc. Similarly,
if we go beyond the standard model of physics i.e. in the symmetry theory of SU(11), we see there
are five neutral particles of the latent energy group SU(6), in which two pairs, namely 𝐉𝐊𝟑 ,
𝐉𝐊𝟖 and 𝐉𝐊𝟏𝟓 , 𝐉𝐊𝟐𝟒 were interchanged without any colour changes, but the neutral particle 𝐉𝐊𝟑𝟓 , like as 𝐙 𝟎 also
create a strong neutral current as SU(6) is very strong i.e. electromagnetic interaction through the frame-work
via SU(6)U(1), may be called as pseudo-electromagnetic interaction which may responsible for
living matter or cells or cells-division,…etc. with the consciousness sensory together with material
weak electromagnetic interaction achieved via the frame-work of SU(2)  U(1). This type of
electromagnetic forces formed in the frame-work of SU(6)U(1) may be used for the treatment in
medical sciences where it is required for the prevention of unwanted cells -division like as
cancer,….etc. where it is required energy therapy. We observe that, towards unification of SU(3),
SU(2), U(1), the strength of weak force gradually increases while strength of strong force gradually
decreases and ultimately we found the unified group SU(5). So, in the theory of SU(11) i.e. in
another phase we found quark-like & lepton-like particles, which may be five times of each quark [
i.e. u-quark, d-quark,…..etc. of the standard model of physics of the unified group SU(5) ] or each
of five different quarks [namely, { 𝒖𝟏 , 𝒖𝟐 ,….,𝒖𝟓 }-quarks, {𝒅𝟏 , 𝒅𝟐 ,.….,𝒅𝟓 }-quarks,…etc.]. Thus 𝐙 𝟎 like neutral particle of SU(6) like zero mass & charges instead of 𝑱𝑲𝟑𝟓 interact with other particles of
SU(5) creating strong neutral current with conscious sensory information system also there may be possible to
created new particles binding by the Jk–bosons of SU(6) with quark-likes and formed heavy new unknown
particles [may be as 5-times of the usual protons, neutrons,…etc. which are created by the GUT energy group
of SU(5)] protons-likes, neutrons-likes,….etc. which are naturally unstable and there may be created much
more many others unknown new particles and an electromagnetic forces in the frame-work of SU(6)U(1)
which are solely responsible for living cells. We may remembered that was said by the Royal Raymond Rife
(May 16, 1888 – August 5, 1971) was an American inventor reported after his experiments that a 'beam ray'
device of his invention could weaken or destroy the pathogens by energetically exciting destructive resonances
in their constituent chemicals. Rife claimed to have documented a "Mortal Oscillatory Rate" for
various pathogenic organisms, and to be able to destroy the organisms by vibrating them at this
particular rate.
Furthermore, various parts of the cell can be likened to parts of the human body in their functional
roles. Plasma membrane and cortex correspond to the skin and the musculature of a cell and it
consists of small autonomously moving “microplasts". Their autonomy implies that cel ls contain a

control system preventing the autonomous units from moving independently and randomly. The
bulk cytoplasm including the mitochondria, organelles and intermediate filaments comprises the
actual cell body excluding the nucleus, and correspond to the guts and innards of the cell body. Its
main cytoskeletal components are the intermediate filaments although microtubules traverse this
compartment everywhere (Dustin, 1978). Microtubules mediate between the control center (the
centriole) and the autonomous domains. The control centre detects objects and other cells by
pulsating near infrared signals. In response to external electromagnetic signals, the centrosome is
expected to send destabilizing signals along the array of microtubules radically emanat ing from it.
The signal is then transducer into a mechanical or electrical wave that can propagate along the
microtubules similar to action potentials along nerves. The work of Albrecht -Buehler (1995) is of
great importance since it could be interpreted as providing a well-studied example of protoconsciousness at the cell level where the cell receives signals from its environment analyzes them
and reacts appropriately. These signals can be electromagnetic and at least some of the processing
involves quantum effects. Along these lines, McFadden (2002) proposed an electromagnetic field
theory of consciousness. Almost 50 years ago Frohlich (1968) theorized that the efficiency of
biological processes is largely due to quantum coherence effects which were hypoth esized by him
to involve the nonlinear coupling of vibrations of cellular membranes to dipole modes of the
phospholipids molecules. He further postulated that a Bose –Einstein condensation phenomenon is
at play leading to the occupation of a single mode of quantum excitation and an associated
phenomenon of long-range order. While normally Bose–Eintein condensates are properties of
systems at very low temperatures, according to Frohlich, biological systems found a way of using
this effect at physiological temperatures due to the nonlinear coupling involved. Moreover,
thermal energy is used to drive the process as an incoherent pump. Frohlich condensates have
never been definitively demonstrated experimentally, but recently there has been renewed
interest and some experimental support, at least for weak condensates (Abbott et al., 2008). The
latter could play a dramatic role in chemical kinetics of far -from-equilibrium biological nanosystems. Frohlich further postulated that quantum coherence is an inherent pro perty of living
cells, which utilize it for long-range interaction purposes including synchronization of cell division
processes and cell–cell recognition. It is only possible due to the excess production of J k bosons of
SU(6) in the early universe playing a key role for everything. So far only scant experimental
evidence exists to support these claims. Engel et al. (2007) investigated photosynthesis from the
point of view of quantum energy transfer and accomplished a major bre akthrough. Photosynthesis
is known to be a very complex process of light energy harvesting in which a water molecule is split
by photon energy creating a set of subsequent chemical reactions. The amazing efficiency of this
process is an example of evolutionary achievement by one-tuning the performance of physical
systems to near perfection. Chromophores are the molecules which are the primary receptors of
light that become excited and pass the excitation energy i n a multi-stage process to the final
reaction center which leads to charge separation. Since the photon wavelength is many times
larger than the size of the molecular complex, a quantum superposition state is created which
covers many excited pigment molecules with a lifetime of hundreds of femto -seconds. They
investigated the process using lasers to excite and probe the pulses and the associated relaxation
process of the light harvesting systems. They detected a quantum beating effect in which the
maximum amplitude of the excitation repeatedly positi ons itself with different molecules of the
complex in a coherent fashion. As a consequence, a significant speed -up of the energy transfer
process is accomplished. It is important to stress that the molecular architecture of the complex is
highly condensed which is suggestive of being the result of an optimized design process aimed at
exploiting long-range quantum coherence processes. Proper timing used in the process allows the
system to capture the coherent excitation with a greater probability compared to the one
obtained if it was simply distributed according to the rules of classical statistics (Blankenship &
Engel, 2010). In the light-sensitive complexes, reaction centers capture individual photons and
transfer exciton energy by tunneling avoiding de-coherence even at room temperatures, which has
been invoked on numerous occasions as a serious impediment to quantum biology (Tegmark,
2000) but also defended on various grounds (Hagan et al., 2002) as will be discussed below. These
recent advances in the use of quantum principles to elucidate photosynthesis are very important
in view of the energy transduction being a key. Since the discovery of potassium Kþ channels, a
surge of interest has been aroused to explain their fascinating molecular mechanisms. The se

complexes that are assembled by several proteins creating circular pores through the membrane
operate in a fast and precise manner. KcsA is a potassium channel c onducting Kþ ions with a high
flux rate (107 108 ions per second) (MacKinnon, 2003) while se lecting Kþ over Naþ with a
remarkable rate of 104 to 1 (Doyle et al., 1998). It is worth noting that the difference in atomic
radii of Kþ and Naþ is about 0.38 nm. In many ion-channel proteins, flow of ions through the pore
is controlled by a gate, comprised of a selectivity filter that can be activated by electrical,
chemical, light, thermal and/or mechanical interactions. Following the determination of an atomic
resolution structure of the bacterial KcsA channel, might not be able to adequately explain su ch a
delicate selectivity process. Vaziri & Plenio (2010) and Ganim et al. (2011) proposed a quantum
coherence mechanism for the selectivity filter and studied vibrational excitations in Kþ ion channels. They predicted that resonances at the picoseconds (p s) scale in the backbone amide
groups play a role in mediating ion -conduction and ion-selectivity in the selectivity filter.
Summhammer et al. (2012) also investigated the interaction of a single potassium ion within the
surrounding carbonyl dipoles by analyzing solutions of the Schrodinger equation for the bacterial
KcsA ion-channel. They showed that alkali ions can be come highly delocalized in the filter region
even at physiological temperatures. The importance of the ion channels to neurophysiology is
undeniable. If ion channels can operate using the principles of quantum mechanics, then the next
logical step is to demonstrate their potential interactions and entanglement which would then
lead to collective quantum states in neuronal membranes. As will be discussed below, within
neurons arguments can be made about the quantum behavior of their cytoskeletal filaments such
as microtubules. Consequently, the cytoskeleton can interact with ion channels using quantum
entanglement. Beck & Eccles (1992, 2003) argued that the process of neutro-transmitter release in
the functioning of synapses is governed by the quantum uncertainty principle and involves
quantum tunneling. They further suggest that the introduction of quantum indeterminacy into
neurotransmitter release mechanisms would allow for human free will of action. Their notion is
that a quantum process, such as an electron tunneling through an energy barrier, triggers
exocytose. The sheer size of the vesicle and the large number of neurotransmitter molecules
contained in it make it next to impossible to lend itself to quantum tunneling processes. Although
the Beck–Eccles model contains very attractive ideas, the crux of the theory appears to be
incompatible with the present-day molecular biology of vesicular neurotransmitter release (Smith,
2009). Lowenstein (2013) in his recent book made a powerful argument for the usefulness of
quantum processes in receptor functions involving molecular recognition. All sensory inputs
depend on this type of activity (olfaction, vision, sound, touch) and they all involve single
molecules being triggers for amplification of these signals up to the neuron level and eventual
brain activation. This amplification mechanism of the quantum signaling connects the microscopic
and macroscopic levels which is critical to our understanding of the binding problem. At the level
of organs and tissues, it has been demonstrated that the human eye is capable of detecting light at
an extremely low threshold, perhaps as few as 2 –3 photons at a time (Levine, 2000). Similarly,
recent work of Franco et al. (2011) has provided strong arguments to claim that the sense of smell
(olfaction) is based on a quantum resonant energy transfer mechanism involving vibrational
degrees of freedom of aromatic molecu les and receptors in the membranes of olfactory nerves.
Although the foregoing examples have been in the literature for a number of years, they have not
led to a widespread acceptance that quantum physics is important for biology.

What is Consciousness?

To the question "What is consciousness?" the brain researcher Christof Koch responds,
"Your inner experience", adding "That experience is generated somewhere in the catacombs of the
cerebrum. How this comes about, is a deep mystery."
Rather cryptically, Wolf Singer speaks of a "phase transition". According to Gerhard Roth,
consciousness is "a physical state sui generis obeying various particular laws of nature", however,
without further specifying what those laws might be. One should expect t hat a new generation of
young researchers would come up with new ideas. Conference of Natural Research Scientists and
Physicians, speech “On the Limits of the Knowledge of Nature”: “It is definitely and forever
incomprehensible that it should not be unimpo rtant for a number of Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen,
Oxygen, etc. atoms how they lie and move. There is absolutely no way to understand how
consciousness could emerge from their connection. As already noted, with regard to the

appearance of a definitely different quality namely, that of consciousness, the term emergence is
often used these days. However, “emergence” is not an explanation at all, and we have to
understand how to explain the new quality scientifically. All the sciences dealing with nature and,
in particular, human beings, are concerned with objects full of color, diversity, and beauty. At
school we learned that physics is the science of inanimate nature. By this the opposition and
prejudice against the scientific explanation of consciousness have been preprogrammed. Also in
this respect, quantum theory has initiated a radical change. This presently is realized by the
researchers in various scientific fields. Only quantum theory can establish, why in molecules
something completely different from th e original atoms can emerge with entirely new
characteristics. In the chemical bonding of atoms to a molecule the electrons of the atomic
valence shells are ‘socialized’ to forming a new whole, and all that can only be explained by
quantum theory. Ultimately, quantum theory also allows us to understand the great leap from
inanimate matter to the area of living beings in the course of evolution. In the following we shall
discuss why and how quantum theory allows ourselves to go from the physiology of the bra in to a
scientific understanding of the conscious and unconscious components of its information
processing, which, for humans, may be designated by the term psyche.
With respect to consciousness, there is no coherent view as to what is and causes
consciousness. Some neuroscientists would say that it is the connections between the neurons and
the coherent firing patterns thereof. Some physicists would propose that it is connected to the
measurement problem in quantum theory and thus the solution lies there. A few philosophers
would suggest that it is an emergent property of the complex brain or a new kind of properties and
laws are required. Philosophically, Searle argues that consciousness is an emergent biological
phenomenon thus cannot be reduced to physic al states in the brain. Chalmers argues that
consciousness cannot be explained through reduction, because mind does not belong to the realm
of matter. In order to develop a consciousness theory based on this approach, Chalmers suggests
expanding science in a way still compatible with today’s scientific knowledge and outlines a set of
fundamental and irreducible properties to be added to space -time, mass, charge, spin etc. and a
set of laws to be added to the laws of Nature. On the theoretical front, there a re quite a few
quantum theories of mind. Among these, Penrose’s Objective Reduction (“OR”) together with
Hameroff’s microtubule computation is perhaps the most popular, and the combination of the two
produced the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (“Orch OR” ) in microtubules. There are also a
number of theories based on conventional neuroscience. Our view on these is that whatever the
final accepted version based on neuroscience (“classical physics”), it could be accepted as
classically correct. The reason is that we must rely on the classical parts of the brain working
according to conventional neuroscience to provide us the necessary neural components and
wirings such as coherent neural firings, neurotransmitter releases and neural plasticity to support
any realistic quantum activities of the brain. The situation is much like that in quantum
computation where classical components form the supporting system of a quantum computer.
Without these classical components, quantum computation could not be implemented at all.
At the turn of the 20th century, physics was perceived by its practitioners to be as solid as
rock, only to be shaken to the core by the discovery of quantum mechanics. Today, perhaps the
most dynamically expanding branch of science is molecular an d cellular biology which is amassing
impressive reams of data well ahead of its proper integration and deep analysis. Quantum biology
is emerging gradually as a response to the challenge of explaining such important, yet poorly
understood phenomena as photosynthesis, bioenergetics, vision, olfaction, bird navigation, etc.
Yet, the grandest challenge of all is to explain how our brains work and, in particular, how does
conscious behavior emerge from the structure and function of the human brain and its cellu lar and
sub-cellular components.
In this article we introduce a new conception about the creation of consciousness. In quantum
theories of consciousness, it is suggested that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe. Our
physical universe appeared by a continuous symmetry breaking of the new energy sources as explained in my
previous articles [The Complex Model Of The Universe, IOSR Journal of Mathematics (IOSRJM) ISSN:22785728 Volume 2, Issue 4 (Sep-Oct 2012), PP 41-45 www.iosrjournals.org]. It was shown that our physical
universe actually unfolded from 10-dimensional space-time that means from the symmetry breaking of the
Super Unified Gaussian Energy Group SU(11) with two fundamental sub groups SU(6) called intelligence and
SU(5) called Unified Gaussian Energy Group which also breaks into three forces namely the strong force SU(3),

the weak force SU(2) and the electrodynamics U(1) of the standard model of physics constituted so called
matter atoms like hydrogen then gradually heavy matter particles atoms by increasing atomic numbers. In the
similar manner it is to be assumed that the bio-molecules or cell divisions will be occurred by a suitable
situations with the energy particles forming by the various elements of the matter energy group of SU(5)
together with the new energy sources of SU(6), SU(12),…etc., formed at first single cell lives then gradually
multiple cells lives increased by the process of cell divisions. There is a common system of formation for the
construction of a complete identity body like human within its parts or tree within its parts similarly stars
within its planets etc. It is very interesting that there exists a common system for each and every creation, for
example our physical universe unfolded with 10-dimensional (so called) real space-time started[in which 30number latent energy bosons of SU(6) changes to 30-number matter energy boson of SU(5) by exchanging the
J-bosons of SU(11)] but it comprehended 4-dimensionally because the inflation occurred from Big-Bang(by
increasing matter elements formed by quarks with gluon etc.) controlled by consciousness then expanded or
developed till to the Big-Break singularity then contraction up-to the Big-Crunch singularity and then real
space-time are being ended[according to Einstein GRT that the real time can’t be defined outside the
gravitating sphere] this system would be compared with the humans or any other lives where unfolded or
development started from their parents(time started for calculation) then developed(body formation) till
birth(then unfolded) then continuously increased all-round development till to the attaining a certain
age(time) and then contraction(like from Big-Break singularity) will be occurred till death. The said systems
continuing and also controlled by consciousness for lives and trees which also then controlled next generation
and also similarly controlled the formation of stars with its planets etc. but it can’t created the next generation
because these stars etc. are formed purely by the energy group SU(5)[SU (3)  SU(2)  U(1)] instead of
SU(11)[  SU( 6)  SU (3)  SU(2)  U(1)]. The formation of living bodies are constructed mainly on the basis
of co-valence compounds namely carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen etc. that means “carbon based” instead of
electro-valence compounds in the earth-like planets it may be different for others earth-like planets that
means may be “silicon-based”. In the live bodies the material compounds constructed by the elements of
SU(5) but they are tightly binding by the bosons of the new energy group of SU(6) that means lives or humans
are formed by “Quark-Like” particles with tightly binding by the Jk–bosons of SU(6)and hence two or more
compounds like polymers together behaves like a single bio-atom or molecule with creating consciousness,
mind,...etc. are by the strong electromagnetic forces or currents created by SU(6) in the frame-work of SU(6) 
U(1) and also with an weak electromagnetic forces or currents created by the energy group SU(2) in the
framework of SU(2)  U(1). When the parts of the lives or not created by the energy group SU(5) are
completely failure by the energy sources of SU(6) then we called it was nonliving matters or otherwise the lives
was then dead. We may assumed that the energy group SU(6) having much more fundamental role for the
creation of everything of our physical universe it may be compared with “Mythological God” whenever we
assumed that our-self as human having minds and consciousness. Since consciousness requires a physical
substrate in the form of a living organism, and in particular the human brain, quantum biology appears to
provide a natural connection between quantum physics and a quantum theory of consciousness. Classical
mechanics is not an appropriate framework within which consciousness could be properly elucidated (Stapp,
1995).

The Cemi-field theory conceives that the electromagnetic field in the brain fine tunes the probabilities
of neuron firings. The affected neurons may be a part of the larger connected assemblies, and this leads to
memory and learning. In simulated networks non-synaptic neuronal interactions via the electromagnetic field
and also gap junctions enhance learning. Modulation of long term potentiating by electromagnetic fields has
also been demonstrated in vitro in rat hippocampus slices.

How consciousness arises from brain action

How does the brain produce consciousness? The mechanism by which the brain produces
consciousness remains mysterious (Koch, 2004). The prevalent scientific view is that consciousness somehow
emerges from complex computation among simple neurons which each receive and integrate synaptic inputs
to a threshold for bit-like firing. The brain as network of 1011 “integrate -and-fire” neurons computing by bitlike firing and variable strength chemical synapses is the standard model for computer simulations of brain
function, e.g. in the field of artificial intelligence (“AI”). The brain-as-computer view can account for nonconsciousness cognitive functions including much of our mental processing and controlled behaviour. Such
non-conscious cognitive processes are deemed “zombie” modes, “auto pilot” or “easy problems”. The “hard
problem” (Chalmers, 1996) is the question of how cognitive processes are accompanied or driven by

phenomenal conscious experience and subjective feelings, referred to by philosophers as qualia”. Other issues
also suggest the brain-as-computer view may be incomplete, and that, other approaches are required. The
conventional brain-as-computer view fails to account for: “The hard problem‟. Distinctions between
consciousness and non-consciousness processes are not addressed, consciousness is assumed to emerge at a
critical level (neither specified testable) of computational complexity mediating otherwise non-conscious
processes. Non-computable thought and understanding, as shown by Godel ′s theorem (Penrose, 1980,
1994).Causal efficacy of consciousness and any semblance of free will. Because measurable brain activity
corresponding to a stimulus often occurs after we have responded (seemingly consciously) to that stimulus,
the brain - as-computer view depicts consciousness as epiphenomenal illusion (Dennett, 1991; 1995; Wegner,
2002). Field levels, we present one example of a potential bidirectional information flow that is based on the

central role of Ca ions under the control of various neuronal proteins. In this concept Ca is viewed upon as
an informational vehicle influencing the activity state of the neuron,( based on the data of Pereira and Furlan,
2007). Similar schemes could be imagined for other molecular mechanisms, mediating the tuning of cellular
activity into large scale patterns, in the context of the creation of higher mental functions. As potential
candidates, the hydrogen atom in relation to H2O and unpaired electron spins as present in DNA, other metal
ions, as well as present in O2 and NO molecules (if associated with membrane proteins), have been proposed
(Hu and Wu, 2004).

Revised Standard Model of Physics and Origin of Biology
The problem of consciousness has defied conventional approaches which view the brain as a
classical computer, with neurons and synapses playing the roles of bit states. Specifically, the
following enigmatic features remain unexplained: (1) the hard problem of the nature of conscious
experience, qualia, our inner life, (2) binding of disparate brain processes into unified concepts,
objects and sense of self, (3) transition from pre-conscious processes to consciousness itself, (4)
free will, or non-algorithmic (e.g., intuitive) processes, (5) subjective flow of time, (6) non -locality.
Conventional neuronal-level computational approaches suggest conscious experience emerges at a
critical level of complexity. Binding is proposed to be accounted for by temporal synch rony (e.g.,
coherent 40 Hz oscillations) but with no sense of the nature of conscious experience, temporal
synchrony is merely correlative rather than explanatory. Perhaps the most potentially tractable
problem is the transition from preconscious processes to consciousness itself. It is generally agreed
upon that the vast majority of brain processes are non -conscious and that consciousness is the tip of
an iceberg of brain activity. However no specific brain area houses consciousness; neural activity in
a given area may be non-conscious at one moment, and correspond with consciousness at another.
What causes the transition? The classical approach suggests a critical level of complexity results in
the transition via emergence of consciousness, but again no th reshold, biological correlate nor
testable prediction have been put forth. Free will, subjective time flow and non -locality have not
been seriously addressed by conventional approaches (except to deny their existence).
Another shortcoming of conventional approaches is that neurons and synapses are considered as
simple switches, whereas real biological cells are far more complex. For example single cell
organisms such as Paramecium swim, avoid obstacles and predators, learn, find ing food and mates,
all without possessing a single synapse. These cognitive functions can potentially be accomplished
by the cell's cytoskeletal structures, primarily microtubules which will be discussed below. Inspired
by the application of quantum theoretical methods to the study of the brain and other biological
structures scientists began to investigate brain functioning from the microscopic level of quantum
physics. Perhaps the first attempt to describe the brain using the terminology of quantum physics
was made by Ricciardi & Umezawa (1967). Based on experimental observations of brain activity
they proposed that the brain could be conceived of as a spatially distributed system placed into
particular quantum states by stimuli from the external environment. Thus, information can b e
thought of as being coded into the brain in the form of meta -stable excited states representative of
short-term memory. This code would then be later on transferred to the ground state of the system
by means of a condensation to the ground state in the m anner of Bose-Einstein condensation
accounting for learning and long-term memory. This model proposes that brain functions are
manifestations of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the dynamics of the brain regulated by long range correlations. The model put forth by Ricciardi & Umezawa (1967) and Stuart et al. (1978)
relating macroscopic quantum states to brain function, memory specifically, was later extended
proposing that the brain is a mixed physical system (Jibu & Yasue, 1995). In this model the brain is
considered to consist of two distinct interacting parts, the first part consisting of the classical
electrochemical interactions of the neurons of the brain, and the second being the macroscopic
quantum state responsible for the creation and maintenance o f memory at a molecular level.
Alternatives to computational emergence (Scott, 1995) include dualism (consciousness lies outside
science), pan-protopsychism (precursors of conscious experience are fundamental, irreducible
components of reality) and quantum information processing approaches (Litt et al., 2006). Major
effort has been specifically placed on the explanation of the role of protein polymers and their
networks located within individual cells and known collectively as the cytoskeleton (Hameroff,
1997, 1998; Hameroff & Watt, 1982). Penrose (1989, 1994) examined the relationship between
consciousness and modern physics in a tour de force exposition of Turing machines, Godel's
theorem, chaos, classical and quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, relativity, cosmology, quantum
gravity, quasi-crystals and brain neurophysiology. He introduced mathematics as a bridge from the
artificial world of computers to the natural world of physics and argued via Godel's incompleteness
theorem that human consciousness is no n-algorithmic, and thus that physical theories of brain
function are incomplete due to their dependence on computable algorithmic laws. He further
hypothesized that quantum effects play a fundamental role in the understanding of human
consciousness by enabling the brain to perform non-computable operations. In his explanation of
the new physics required to explain the mind and consciousness, he examined the division between
classical and quantum physics, specifically the measurement problem, and related the collapse of
the wave function to conscious events using the notion of objective reduction. This led to the
suggestion that microtubules within neurons provide the brain with structures capable of
orchestrating the collapse of the wave function via quantum information processing. This union has

Revised Standard Model of Physics and Origin of Biology
been known as the Penrose–Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR) theory
(Hameroff & Penrose, 2014). The basic idea is that microtubules within the brain's neurons function
as quantum computers, with microtubule protein subunits (tubulins) existing transiently in quantum
superposition of two or more states (i.e., as quantum bits, or \qubits). According to Orch OR,
tubulin qubits in quantum superposition interact /compute with other superpositioned tubulins in
microtubule lattices (Roberts & Hyams, 1979) by nonlocal quantum enta nglement, eventually
reducing (collapsing) to particular classical tubulin states after 25 milliseconds or so (e.g., at 40
Hz). The quantum state reductions yield conscious perception s and volitional choices, which then
govern neuronal actions. This is essentially the same idea on which technological quantum
information processing is based, except that in Orch OR the proposed qubits are tubulin protein
conformations, and the reduction/collapse occurs due to a specific objective threshold (objective
reduction) rather than environmental interaction. Objective reduction is a solution to the
measurement problem in quantum theory, which considers the superposition of quantum states as a
separation in underlying reality at its most basic level, the Planck scale. The solution involves a
description of loop quantum gravity, which identifies wave function superposition as curvatures of
opposite direction in space-time, and thus a separation in fundamental space-time geometry. These
separations are considered unstable and reduce to a single space -time curvature once an objective
threshold is reached. The theory considers a conscious event as quantum information processing,
which concludes via objective state reduction. The biological conditions in the brain, including
synaptic activity, are considered to influence the quantum information processing thus orchestrating
the collapse of the qubits and giving rise to a conscious event. Orch OR is an atte mpt to place
consciousness within the empirical sciences as a fundamental concept in science. The central
postulate of the Orch OR theory is that the site of action of consciousness is located within the
brain's microtubules which operate at the interface between classical neurophysiology and quantum
gravitational forces. These are very bold claims that have found both ardent supporters and vocal
critics in the scientific community. However, the enduring power of attraction of Orch OR for a
solid base of support across science, philosophy and beyond is a testament to the creative influence
of this work on the field. The main concerns with Orch OR can be broadly separated into the
following three categories (Grush & Churchland, 1995; Koch & Hepp, 2006; Seife, 2000). (1)The
empirical evidence demonstrating how the activity of a single synapse enters into the dynamics of
neural assemblies is lacking, thus the relevance of quantum processes in mental phenomena remains
a claim requiring validation. (2) As of yet, there appears to be no specific quantum mechanical
properties needed to explain psychological and neurological phenomena. The relevance of quantum
effects to the structure and function of the brain does not necessitate their involvement in
explaining consciousness. Although this point can be argu ed in view of the hard problem.(3)
Structures such as microtubules and neurons are large, high temperature systems from the quantum
mechanical point of view. As such, it is next to impossible for them to remain in s tates of linear
superposition capable of coherently interfering with one another, thus de -coherence eliminates any
possibility of quantum effects playing a role in brain processes. This point has been already
discussed above and is still an open issue. There have been many debates concerning whether the
quantum description of consciousness is valid, realistic or needed. However, only recently have
advances in nanotechnology allowing for serious empirical investigation into the biophysical
workings of sub-cellular structures been made. As such, the lack of evidence in support of quantum
brain theories should not be taken as proof against these theories, but rather as an area in need of
careful and vigorous scientific investigation. The several enigmatic featu res of consciousness
mentioned previously are still, for the most part, left unexplained by classical theories. The
apparent ability of quantum theories to answer these questions may provide new avenues of
investigation into consciousness. It is known that macroscopic quantum phenomena such as
superconductivity, super fluidity and laser action exist at relatively high temperatures (albeit
requiring very finely tuned conditions) and that these phenomena cannot be explained via classical
means, but rather require the idea of macroscopic quantum coherence within a condensate.
Therefore, it can be stated that not all phenomena observed in large -scale systems can be expected
to behave classically. Thus, while the first two arguments against quantum consciousness represent
a general resistance to the idea, the third is an argument of worthwhile concern. Macroscopic
quantum phenomena such as superconductivity, and super fluidity require high isolation from their
environment in order to avoid the effects of de -coherence. In order for such phenomena to exist in
the brain, nature would need to provide mechanisms to isolate against de -coherence. The subject of
de-coherence in relation to quantum information processing in microtubules particularly has been
widely discussed and strong arguments have been made on both sides of the discussion. Tegmark

(2000) made a major objection specifically to the Orch -OR theory, and the notion of a quantum
brain in general, based on calculations of neural de -coherence rates for both regular neuron firings
and for kink-like polarization excitations in microtubules. He claimed that the degrees of freedom
in the human brain should be considered classical rather than quantum. Tegmark found de coherence time-scales for superposition of solitons moving along a microtubule of approximately
-13
- 11
10 –10 s, which are much shorter when compared with the relevant time -scale for cognitive
-3
-1
processes of 10 –10 s. Thus, he concluded that quantum coherence within the brain is not feasible.
However, Hagan et al. (2002) pointed out that Tegmark's calculations are based on an incorrect
model of the Orch-OR process. Accounting for this discrepancy, as well as for the effects that
screen thermal fluctuations, such as layers of ordered water and actin gel states surrounding
-5
-4
microtubules, Hagan et al. (2002) found new de-coherence rates of 10 –10 s that are in line with
relevant dynamical times of biological phenomena. These arguments are both refuted by Rosa &
Faber (2004) who find, based on de -coherence calculations, that the Orch-OR model based on
gravitational collapse is incompatible with de -coherence, but that the notion of quantum phenomena
in the brain are still feasible if decoherence is taken as a quantum collapse mechanism rather than a
quantum gravity effect. Coherence times can be extended by counterion shielding, actin shielding,
intrinsic error correction, among other properties; nonetheless, de -coherence remains as an issue
(Hagan et al., 2002). However, as discussed above, recent experiments have show n room
temperature quantum effects in photosynthesis (Engel et al., 2007) and conjugated polymer chains
(Collini & Scholes, 2009). Nonthermal radiation at 8.085 MHz has been observed from MTs, and
while not necessarily an indication of a quantum condensate or coherence, it remains a possibility
(Pokorný et al., 2001). Reimers et al. (2009) and McKemmish et al. (2009) state that this radiation
could only be the result of a weak condensate that could not result in the coherent motion necessary
for the Penrose–Hameroff model, however their results are based on a linear chain of coupled
oscillators rather than the cylindrical geometry of MTs leaving the question still open. Another
issue at hand is the range of motion in tubulin dimers when they are polymerized into stable MTs,
bringing into question whether intact MTs allow two potential conformations of tubulin dimers.
McKemmish et al. (2009) clearly demonstrate that repeated exchanges between the GTP and GTP bound forms of tubulin within MTs are not supported by current experimental evidence. While the
conformational states are generally identified as tubulin -GTP and tubulin-GDP the Penrose–
Hameroff model does not specify the precise nature of the conformational states envisaged, so
alternatives remain a possibility, however the consistency of the timescales between such
interactions and the Penrose–Hameroff requirements remains an open question. Clearly, these issues
are not completely resolved. Thus, investigations into the quantum nature of microtubules are s till
badly needed. At any rate, crucial validation or falsification of Orch OR must come from
experimentation. This is very challenging since the current \gold standard" in neuroscience is fMRI
whose spatial resolution is on the 1 mm scale while temporal r esolution is on the 1 s scale. This is
orders of magnitude higher than the 1nm and1ns scales of tubulin's size/time operational
dimensions as studied by molecular biophysics, let alone the quantum gravity effects hypothesized
-35
-44
by Orch OR to be occurring on the Planck scale of space-time geometry (10 m; 10 s). This huge
gap between the current experimental capabilities and the predictions made by Orch OR poses the
greatest challenge to the acceptance of these tenets.

Photon and Electric Charge-Mediated Consciousness

The change of a larger group SU(11) of symmetries to the subgroup SU(6) SU(5) U(1) is
spontaneous by the redistribution of energy particles from the stage like gaseous as explained previously. The
above mentioned subgroup which contained the U(1) group, there inevitably arises particles (whose annihilation
formed charge particles) that have the characteristics like a magnetic mono-pole. Typically, the mass of which
(in energy units) may be ~ 𝟏𝟎𝟏𝟗 Gev (Plank energy). Monopoles like charge particles are highly stable particles
and once created are not destructible. And so they would survive as relics to the present epoch. The explanation
of the two energy group SU(5) and SU(6) of the SUT energy group SU(11), we begin with an analogy of
ferromagnetism and crucial role of the Curie-temperature (𝟕𝟕𝟎𝟎 𝐂 for iron). Above this temperature a bar of iron
shows no magnetism in an external field. This is because its elementary nuclear magnets are randomly aligned
with no resultant magnetization. Energetically, this is the lowest state for the bar and it chooses to remain in that
state as the most stable one. Bellow the Curie temperature the state of lowest energy changes to that in which all
the nuclei are aligned along the bar, which develops polarity at its ends. There are two states of the same lowest
energy possible, depending on which (north or south) of the two poles falls at a given end. The ultimate choice
of one state apparently breaks symmetry although theoretically and inherently the symmetry is always there. In
the early universe something similar-like happened to the Super Unified Theory of SU(11) and then SU(5).

corresponds to a situation when φ has non-zero values. Corresponding to states of the same lowest energy, let us
suppose that there exist alternative values 𝛗𝐢 (i =1, 2, 3....) which now acquire that status of vacuum. There were
basic symmetry with respect to all 𝛗𝐢 , but in practice the system may spontaneously acquire one of them. This is
again an apparent break-down of the symmetry. The consequences of this for the very early universe are that it
is divided into different domains, each with a different value of 𝝋𝒊 . In this way the universe acquires
discontinuities along the domain walls. These translate into highly significant discontinuities of matter
distribution. The fact that we do not see such discontinuities in actuality (say in the form of large sheets of
matter) is hard to explain away. This difficulty is known as the domain wall problem. The intersection of two
domain walls is a linear structure known as “cosmic-string” such filamentary structure have been invoked in
scenarios for galaxy form.

Cognitive behaviors of single cell organisms

Protozoan‟s like Paramecium can swim, find food and mates, learn, remember and have sex,
all without synaptic computation (Sherrington, 1957). In the 1980s Penrose and Hameroff
(Separately) began to address these issues, each against the grain of mainstream views. Hameroff
had been intrigued by seemingly intelligent, organized activities inside cells, accomplished by
protein polymers called microtubules (Hameroff and Watt, 1982; Hameroff, 1987 ). Major
components of the cells structural cytoskeleton, microtubules also accounted for precise separation
of chromosomes in cell division, complex behavior of Paramecium, and regulation of synapses
within brain neurons. He assured the intelligent function and periodic lattice structure of
microtubules suggested they might function as some type of bio -molecular computer. Microtubules
are self-assembling polymers of the peanut-shaped protein dimer tubulin, each tubulin dimer
(110,000 atomic mass unit) being composed of an alpha and beta monomer. T hirteen linear tubulin
chains (“proto-filaments”) align side-to-side to form hollow microtubule cylinders (25 nanometers
diameter) with two types of hexagonal lattices. The A -lattice has multiple winding patterns which
intersect proto-filaments at specific intervals matching the Fibonacci series found widely in nature
and hence possessing a helical symmetry, which suggestively to a large-scale quantum process.

Quantum Processes in Microtubules?

Empirically, a host of studies indicate that the microtubule (MT) matrix in dendrites is
structurally reorganized with learning and memory. Using an associative learning paradigm
combined with immune-histo-chemistry, fear conditioning to either tone or to the training context
induced significant changes in the microtubule associated protein (MAP2) in circumscribed regions
of the cerebral cortex or hippocampus, with alterations correlating with the type of training
(Woolf et al., 1994, 1999). In terms of molecular biophysics, based on their ability to propagate
signals through the neuron (Brown & Tuszynski, 1997), MTs and actin filaments can be viewed as
computationally relevant nanowire networks that operate within neurons (Woolf et al., 2010).
Rather than inputs to neurons being limited to causing discrete responses, this viewpoint odes the
possibility of local and global neuro -plasticity, based on the cytoskeleton computing and storing
templates that translate patterns of inputs across widespread synapses into the behavioral output
of the neuron (Abbott & Regehr, 2004). This behavioral output of the neuron is not limited to
axonal firing and dendritic integration of electrochemically mediated inputs. Instead, it includes
connecting the cell nucleus with the postsynaptic density, initiating transport of receptor
molecules, membrane proteins, organelles and mRNA, regulating neuritis motility, restructuring of
spines and complex dendrite architecture, the lateral movement of receptor and membrane
proteins of neurons, governing the availability of ion channels in the membrane and more.
Potential computational modes for MTs and actin filaments are beginning to be understood (Priel
et al., 2006). There is empirical evidence that shows signaling, communication and c onductivity in
microtubules (Gundersen & Cook, 1999) and theoretical models have demonstrated their potential
for both digital and quantum information processing. Arguments for and against the existence of
quantum effects in MTs are numerous. To investigat e the existence of quantum computation in
microtubule protein assemblies Craddock et al. (2009) modeled this system via cellular automata
using both classical and quantum neighbor rules. Using a typical MT configuration and a tubulin
neighborhood in a hexagon configuration, they represented the interior of tubulin electro statically and showed that it contains two areas of positive charge separated by a negative

potential region constituting a double well potential. The position of a mobile electron within this
double potential well was the determining factor for the state of an individual tubulin dimer, with
transitions determined by the minimization of the systems energy associated with electrostatic
interactions of neighboring electrons and thermal effect s. Classically the model allows transitions
for electrons with sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier (taken as 100 – 150 meV) in
which the new configuration lowers the system's energy, or if the configuration raises the systems
energy with a finite probability of exp(E=kT). The quantum cellular automaton model allows the
electron to tunnel through the potential barrier with transitions for which the energy is lowered
even if the electron does not possess the necessary energy to overcome the pot ential barrier.
These simulations have shown that information processing at physiological temperatures is
feasible provided a global clocking mechanism is present. However, it should be emphasized that
many of the simulation parameters are not known empiri cally. Several frameworks have been
proposed to reconcile the mental and the physical states. Most of these attempts start with relatively monodisciplinary assumptions to tackle the mind-brain or mind body problem. This essay analyzes some general
concepts on brain functioning based on recent neurobiological investigations and discusses these with those
originating primarily in quantum mechanical approaches. More precisely: we stress the importance of both
quantum and classical molecular states for higher cerebral and, by implication, mental processes. Firstly,
various mind/brain concepts are discussed including emergent materialism, i.e. the idea that the interaction of
the constituting components of the brain (i.e., neuronal networks or molecular communication networks in
cells) creates emergent and largely unpredictable properties that ultimately produce our experience of mind.
We examine the relationship between brain energy metabolism and general brain functions, and argue that
they are, by and large, unrelated. We propose that brain metabolism serves to maintain a high energy state
(“potential energy”) and isoenergicity to ensure future activities. High energy molecular perturbations are
supposed to be easily amplified to become meaningful signals for the organism. Together with the stored
information, acquired during life, a “personal universe” is created.
Secondly, some recent physical-mathematical theories of mind are examined, denoted here as
quantum mechanical (QM) theories, because they are largely based on quantum physics. The attractiveness of
a quantum theory has been justified by its basic elements of: 1st uncertainty, that means that mental
phenomena are not governed by classical physical laws of determinism and causation, so that there is room for
intuition and free will; 2nd a universal consciousness with the individual consciousness as participating agents;
3rd consciousness, even seen as a non-physical entity, finally acts in the physical domain and may exert causal
power; 4th explaining mental transitions from apparently non-conscious thoughts and processes to conscious
ones and vice versa; 5th a potential difference between internal time perception and external physical time;
6th the possible non-temporality of the so called past, present and future, that would enable backward
causation in which future events may affect present (and perhaps past) processes. (Figure taken from

Objective Reduction

In 1989 Penrose published “The Emperor’s New Mind”, which was followed in 1994 by
“Shadow of the Mind”. Critical of AI, both books argued by appealing to Go del′s theorem and
other considerations, that certain aspects o f human consciousness, such as “understanding” must be
beyond the scope of any computationa l system, i.e. “non–computable”. Non-computability is a
perfectly well-defined mathematical concept, but it had not previously been considered as a serious
possibility for the result of physical actions. The non -computable ingredient required for human
consciousness and understanding, Penrose suggested, would have to lie in an area where our curr ent
physical theories are fundamentally incomplete, though of important relevance to the scales that are
pertinent to the operation of our brains. The only serious possibility was the in completeness of
quantum theory-an incompleteness that both Einstein and Schrödinger had recognized despite
quantum theory having frequently been argues to represent the pinnacle of 20th century scientific
achievement. Thus, incompleteness is the unresolved issue referred to as the “Gaussian Unified
Theory (GUT) instead of Super Unified Gaussian Theory (SUT)”, which we was consider in more
detail in the present dissertation. One way to resolve it would be to prov ide an extension of the
standard model of physics in the framework of quantum mechanics by introducing a Generalized
Gaussian Energy Group (GGEG) from the Big-Rip Singularity or Revised Standard Model of
Physics as explained above and Penrose introduced an objective form of q uantum state reduction,
termed “OR”, (objective reduction). In Penrose (1989), the tentatively s uggested “OR” proposal
would have its onset determined by a condition referred to there as “the one -graviton criterion”.
However, in Penrose (1995), a much better -founded criterion was used, now sometimes referred to
as the Diosi − Penrose proposal (henceforth “DP”; Diosi 1987, 1989, Penrose 1993, 1996, 2000,
2009). This is an objective physical threshold, providing a plausible lifetime for quantum
superposed states. Other such OR proposals had also been put forward, from time to time (e.g.
Kibble 1981, Pearle 1989, Pearle and Squires 1994, Ghirardi et al., 1986, 1990; Ghirardi 2011) as
solutions to the measurement.

Revised Standard Model of Physics and Origin of Biology
The specific heat of solids satisfies certain empirical relations, as embodied in the Dulong
and Petit law stating that at sufficiently high temperatures, the specific heat of a solid is
proportional to 3Nk, where N is the number of atoms, k the Boltzmann constant. At low
temperatures, the relationship between specific heat and temperature is a cubic dependence on
absolute temperature. The quantum theory of solids, as developed by Debye, was proposed to
explain these empirical relations. The crucial observ ation in these models was the consideration of
the heat capacity as associated with the vibrations of atoms in a crystalline solid. However, living
organisms are essentially isothermal. Energy low in living organisms is mediated by differences in
the turnover time of various metabolic processes in the cell, which occur cyclically. Demetrius
(2003) has shown that the cycle time of these metabolic processes is related to the metabolic rate
that is the rate at which the organism transforms the free energy of n utrients into metabolic work.
The recently proposed theory of Quantum Metabolism (Demetrius, 2003) exploits the
methodology of the quantum theory of solids to provide a molecular level explanation of these
empirical relations. Debye (see for example Ashcro ft & Mermin, 1976) considered the heat
capacity as associated with the harmonic vibrations of atoms in a crystalline solid. The vibrations
were treated according to quantum theory and satisfied the following tenet. The energy stored by
an oscillator with frequency can only be an integral proposed by Debye, which proved to be
consistent with empirical observations, assumed that the atoms in the solid execute coupled
vibrations about the fixed lattice site leading to the propagation of waves in the solid and the
frequencies of these vibrations span a range of values from zero to a maximum (Debye) frequency.
The production of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), the energy currency of living organisms is
mediated by the coupling of two molecular chains: (a) The redox chain, which describes the
transfer of electrons between redox centers within the electrontransport chain. (b) The ATP -ase
motor, which is involved in the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP. There are
two distinct mechanisms by which these two events are coupled: oxidative phosphorylation, which
involves an electrical process, and substrate phosphorylation, which implicates a purely chemical
process. The transit time of this cyclic process determines the total metabolic flux, that is, th e
number of proton charges released by the redox reactions. This transit time, or the metabolic
cycle time, denoted, plays a fundamental role here. In oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs in
the mitochondria, the electron transport between redox centers is coupled to the outward
pumping of protons across the mitochondrial membrane thus generating an electrochemical
gradient, called the proton motive force, p. Substrate phosphorylation, which is localized within
the cytosol is driven by a set of enzymes which couple ADP phosphorylation to the electron
transport chain. The molecular dynamics model proposed to investigate this coupling by electrical
and chemical means assumes that the energy generated by the redox reactions can be stored in
terms of coherent vibrational modes of enzymatic oscillators embedded in the cellular organelles.
Quantum Metabolism rests on the notion that the enzymatic oscillations in cellular organelles and
the material oscillators in crystalline solids can be analyzed in terms of th e same mathematical
formalism used by Debye in the quantum theory of solids. This realization is deduced from a
formal correspondence between the thermodynamic variables in physical systems, and the
metabolic quantities in biological processes. The princip al variables in the quantum theory of
solids are the specific heat, the Gibbs–Boltzmann entropy and the absolute temperature T. The
fundamental unit of energy is given by E ¼ kBT, the typical thermal energy per molecule. The
critical variables in the theory of Quantum Metabolism are the metabolic rate, the entropy
production rate and the mean cycle time. This quantity describes the mean turnover time of the
redox reactions within the cellular organelles. The fundamental unit of energy is now given by: EðÞ
¼ g. Here, the value assumed by EðÞ ¼ g depends on the mechanism, electrical or chemical, by
which the electron transport chain is coupled to ADP phosphorylation. Note that since physical
systems are described here at thermodynamic equilibrium, their param eters involve
thermodynamic variables. Biological systems operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium (albeit
close to steady states), hence their bio -energetic quantities involve fluxes, i.e., rates of change of
energetic values. Demetrius (2003) introduced the term enzymatic oscillator since enzymes
undergo electrochemical oscillations about their fixed positions. These oscillations are generated
by the metabolic energy associated with the transfer of electrons between donor and acceptor
pairs in the electron transfer chain in mitochondria. Since their power spectrum exhibits an
exponent vastly different from that for random behavior, a description of the metabolic activity

involving mitochondrial proteins involves coupled quantum oscillators of the Debye t ype.
Quantization of metabolic energy is due to integer ATP numbers being produced in the cell's
mitochondria and their relatively low energy content comparable to physical quantum processes.
The almost universal energy currency in biological systems is th e ATP molecule. ATP synthesis in a
mitochondrion or a chloroplast requires approximately 60 kJ/mol of energy deliv ered through
electron transport reactions or absorption of photons, respectively , it is only possible when
supplied by exchanging the energy of SU(6) into matter energies of SU(5). ATP hydrolysis releases
30.5 kJ/mol of free energy (E ¼ 5 1020 J), which can be viewed as a biological energy quantum. It is
interesting to note that the particle-wave duality principle indicates that the wavelength o f
electromagnetic energy that corresponds to the biological energy quantum E can be estimated as:
¼ hc=E ¼ 9 106 m; ð2Þ which corresponds very closely to the average size of a living cell. It is also
interesting to estimate the Debye temperature for the bi ological energy quantum assuming that
enzymatic reactions involving ATP production occur in a cyclical but correlated manner in a grid or
lattice reminiscent of the Debye solid. We find that TD ¼ E=kB ¼ 3 103 K and since the
physiological temperature is T0 ¼ 300 K, it appears that T0=TD < 1 meaning that in the statistical
sense, cellular metabolism operates in the quantum regime. This is of crucial importance since
metabolism is a basic condition for sustaining life. In general, energy transduction in livin g systems
involves three major modalities: photosynthesis (in plants and some bacteria), ion gradients and
oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis (in animal cells). If all energy transduction processes in
living systems involve quantum mechanisms, then th is becomes a fundamental property of living
matter. The human brain is no exception. The related time course of the cerebral electrophysiological
activity was described during the initiation and execution of voluntarily behaviour (e.g. movement of the
fingers) by the classical experiments of Libet and later by others. This approach (Libet 2006; Haggard 2005;
Haggard and Eimer, 1999; Soon et al., 2008; Bode et al., 2011) might be regarded as a decision making
experiment and the readiness potential can be seen as to reflect the superposition state of the brain.
Following regional brain activity using fMRI technology (see Bode et al., 2011) showed that the preparation
phase in the anterior frontopolar cortex might precede the decision as much as 6 seconds. Once in the
superposition state, decisions in a laboratory context are made in a very short period of time (already within
50 milliseconds; as in the Turennout, 1998 study) as compared to the preparation time. Spivey and Coworkers, 2007, have emphasized the continuity of mind, rather than sequential states, as opposed to the
quantum approach. They illustrate their ideas with decision-making experiments, showing that the subjects in
an, apparently indecisive, state, stay longer indecisive when the decisions are more ambivalent, once the
choice has been made, the decision is realized faster (Pezzulo et al., 2011; Spivey 2007; 2012). These studies
show that decisions are anticipated far before the overt behaviour (Bode et al., 2011). These laboratory
experiments are compatible with the idea that the central nervous system (the subject) develops a kind of
superposition state before making the choice (the “collapse”). For the subject, the significance of artificial
problem solving, is evidently modest and requires little “mind-space.” More important decisions might require
a “larger space of the personal universe”, and more processing time.

Conclusion

The basic idea is to investigate if there are other quantum network architectures that could
be operating in the brain of the living body. First of all, we need to revised the standard model of
physics for living matters started with the symmetry breaking of the Super Unified Gaussian
Energy Group SU(11) instead of non-living matter clarified by the standard model of physics with
the GUT symmetry breaking of SU(5). We introduced a series of new energy sources SU(6),
SU(12),…etc. other than SU(5) i.e., SU(3), SU(2), U(1), a Generalized Gaussian Energy Group (GGEG)
starting from the infinite space-time as explained in this article where it is assumed that in
quantum theories of consciousness of our physical universe where these new energy sources are
also responsible for creating consciousness…..etc. in the living or nonliving matters. In the theory
of consciousness it is suggested that consciousness is a fun damental property of the universe.
Energies of SU(6) created gravity as well as quantum gravities for the formation of a complete
living and also for non-living bodies with definite shape like stars with its planets,…. etc. and living
cells with its various parts and then cell divisions,…. etc. We assumed SU(6) with all other new
energy sources SU(12), SU(24),…etc. created consciousness in the universe including living organic
cells in planet of earth. The J k bosons of SU(6) binding quark-likes and created forces with much
more new unknown particles which are more responsible between all other chemical compounds,
polymers in bimolecular cells or binding several compound elements in which different ions which
are created different waves but coherently behaves like as a single wave. These J k bosons are so
strong that it changes the exotic matter fluid into ordinary matters , which are also responsible for
the cell divisions and others in Bio-molecules/Atoms etc. whereas all material parts created by the
elements/atoms of the Unified Gaussian energy group SU(5) , that means where quarks are binding
with the gluons created protons, neutrons, electrons,…etc. the matter atoms from hydrogen to
heavy atoms and the so called empty space were filled with the unknown particles or quasiDOI: 10.9790/4861-1101011240

particles formed by the latent energies of SU(6) by creating a strong force. Thus our universe
always filled with some new energy sources in different phase instead of nothing. A particular
amount of material substances are always created by exchanging the bosons of SU(6) into the
bosons of SU(5) for the particular expansive physical universe or within its parts for complete
shaped like as cluster/galaxy/star/planet/animal/human/tree…..etc. hence there is no any
absolute vacuum.
Thus it was shown that our consciousness or intelligences is the part of the universal
consciousness or intelligences and we may consider that the human brain and its mental aspects
are associated with classical brain physiology and are also part of a quantum physical universe.
The human brain conceived as an interfacing organ that not only produces mind and consciousness
but also receives information. The brain or parts of the brain are conceived as an interference
hologram of incoming data and already existing data which equivalent to the subject’s memory.
In quantum entanglement of the GUT in such a network could provide at least a partial
answer to the binding problem of consciousness allowing for a delocalized quantum state involving
many neurons. This requires a thorough understanding of quantum networks in wider sense like
SUT instead of GUT. It is worth emphasizing that quantum networks may lead to quantum
memories whereby entangled states would store information such as visual inputs.
We foresee major progress in bridging the gap between nano -science and consciousness in
the area of nano-neuroscience where MT's, actin filaments and motor proteins connect between
neurophysiology and molecular biology. Studying the neural phenomena at a nano -scale will lead
to monumental breakthroughs in science and medicine in medical sciences and aid in
consciousness studies. We assumed that in future by applying new energy sources creating with
new unknown particles may be used for various critical treatment like cancer,….etc. in medical
sciences for example applying J k bosons of new energy sources of SU(6) binding with quark -like

particles which produces new particles as protons-likes, neutrons-likes,… etc. new unknown
particles are required for the preparation of the new medicine and prevented from critical
diseases like as cancer, dementia, and for mental instability,….etc. That means we made valuable
medicine clinically or pathologically by the proton-likes, neutron-likes,....etc. unknown particles
and these particles having masses may have five times then heavy but not like in matter particle
phase may be in the wave phase or any other form of the usual protons, neutrons,….etc of SU(5)
although the new particles of SU(6) with quark-likes maintained wave-particle duality with the
matter particles formed by quarks with gluons of SU(5) in particular temperature or having
founded much more new unknown particles other than Hadrons, Hyperons, Nucleons,…etc. and
using these particles may be produced with the bindings of quark-likes by Jk–bosons or using
energy therapy by creating strong electromagnetic forces or currents with SU(6) in the frame-work
of SU( 6)  U(1) for the prevention or completely cured by resisting the unwanted cell-divisions like as
cancer,.......etc. for critical illness from the very beginning of lives or human. Further possibilities involving
physically-based quantum mechanisms of consciousness should also be considered. Moreover,
quantum networks could generate communication channels that would transport information an d
process it performing complex operations. Recent experiments involving solid state physics
devices based on nuclear spins demonstrated quantum information storage on the time scale of
minutes or even hours is possible as demonstrated by the walt's group in their research on superlong quantum information storage using phosphorus ions in silicon (Saeedi et al., 2013). However,
several challenging issues remain to be addressed. First of all, due to t hermal fluctuations, a
magnetic field of sufficient strength would be required to prepare the spin system in a pure
enough state. On the other hand, there are no naturally occurring large magnetic fields and we
also know that strong magnetic fields such as those in MRI machines do not have a significant
effect on the state of consciousness of the person subjected to MRI scans. Regarding quantum
communication channels, photon or boson emission and absorption is the best candidate
mechanism for such phenomena. Bio-photonics is an emerging field in spite of its long history of
false starts and intermittent periods of dormancy. A recent review (Cifra et al. 2014) su mmarizes
the landscape in this field emphasizing a relatively narrow range of wavelengths between 350 nm
and 1300 nm. It is also interesting to consider signal amplification and transmission over
macroscopic distances along axons and dendrites of neurons. Understanding the biological basis
for sustained quantum coherent superposition and entanglement would not only help to solve the
enigmatic features of consciousness, but also enable future quantum information technologies.

Quantum physics indicates that consciousness is related to the awareness that an electron appears to
show in the wave/particle duality (double slit experiment). Quantum physicists have shown that the electron
behaves differently when being observed by a human as because there always present the latent energy group
SU(6). When the electron is not being observed, the electron behaves like a wave, but when an observing
instrument is placed in the experiment, the electron behaves like a particle. This experience indicates that the
electron will change its behaviour/reality depending on whether or not the electron is being observed as if the
electron is aware that it is being observed. This awareness is very similar, if not the same, as human awareness
and may be related to the same consciousness. Thus consciousness understood if there creates lives otherwise
it becomes pseudo but working always silently for the formation of our universes and then behaves like
entanglement. Consciousness is, therefore, a non-material entity capable of independent, eternal existence,
and not a property but in some sense may be used as property. Consciousness is not emergent, and is eternal
similar to the electron and others. It can remain localized in the human brain and interact with the brain, and
thereby, control the activities of the human body. While electrons in the brain behave as particles, these
electrons prevent the consciousness from realizing that it is part of a larger whole. When the electrons behave
as a wave, the consciousness becomes aware of its existence outside the human mind, which makes OBE and
NDE possible. Whenever the electron wave function collapses, the OBE and NDE ends and the person returns
to their physical body and its perception of reality similar to the collapsing of the wave function in the double
slit experiment in quantum physics. During the OBE and NDE while the electron is behaving as a wave function,
consciousness can leave the brain and go into an independent floating existence outside the human body
where it can travel independent of space-time similar to the entangled electron.
How does the “I” or “self” or the perceived wholeness of one’s world emerge from a system
consisting of so many parts, billions of neurons. What creates the “Oneness” of thought processes? What
creates individuality and “I”-ness or “self”? What creates feelings, free will, and creativity? The problem is
solved only by making a complete total body assumed like an atom/molecule with the combination of two
different characters of electro-magnetic wave functions producing in two different phases by the symmetry
breaking of SU(11) & SU(5) and with creating new unknown particles then formation of biological particles,
otherwise does not create such feelings etc.
