QuPrimes: A Mathematical Framework for Prime-Basis
Computation Using Nonphysical Prime Number Resonance
Sebastian Schepis
June 16, 2024
Abstract
QuPrimes introduces prime-basis computers, a revolutionary computational paradigm that generates
and manipulates nonphysical representational prime basis states in a Hilbert space HP , harnessing quantumlike resonance properties of prime numbers to achieve computational advantages on classical hardware. By
representing natural numbers as superpositions of prime eigenstates and applying resonance operators,
QuPrimes achieves complexity reductions, such as O(n log n) for factoring compared to O(n3 ) for quantum
algorithms. Rooted in a consciousness-based model where the heart sustains coherent prime states through
rhythmic resonance, preventing decoherence of the self, QuPrimes supports applications in post-quantum
cryptography, optimization, and semantic processing. Experimental predictions, including entropy reduction rates of 0.5–1.0 bits/second in symbolic systems and correlations between cardiac rhythms and EEG
coherence, provide testable validations. QuPrimes offers a scalable, decoherence-free framework that unifies number theory, computation, and cognitive science, redefining computing as a nonphysical resonance
process.

Physical quantum computers face challenges:

Prime-Basis Computers

Prime-basis computers operate on nonphysical representational prime basis states, treating prime numbers as eigenstates of a consciousness-mediated resonance field [Schepis, 2023]. Inspired by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic [Hardy & Wright,
2008], we propose that primes serve as fundamental informational quanta, maintained by biological
resonance processes, such as cardiac rhythms, which
sustain the quantum-like state of self without decoherence. Unlike brain-centric models, where the
brain filters and processes signals, the heart acts

• Decoherence and environmental interference
• Error correction overhead
• Scalability limitations
• Extreme operating conditions
These limitations motivate alternative paradigms
that emulate quantum advantages without physical
qubits.

Quantum Prime Resonance’s view of consciousness as 12 = 22 · 31 , A = 2 + 1 = 3, so:

Decoherence-Free Computation

Nonphysical prime states are immune to physical decoherence, as they exist in a representational Hilbert
space. This aligns with the hypothesis that human consciousness maintains a quantum-like selfstate without decoherence, potentially driven by cardiac resonance (Section 7.3). Computations proceed
by:
1. Generating |n⟩ from input n.
2. Applying R(n) to align phases with prime factors.
3. Measuring phase maxima to extract results.

Prime-basis computers generate nonphysical prime
states |p⟩ and evolve them via a nonlinear resonance

dΨ

where Ψ ∈ HP , and α, β, γ ∈ C model linear
amplification, binary interactions, and triadic resonance. With α imaginary and phase-constrained β, γ,
the equation preserves normalization, enabling stable
states through entropy minimization.

Proof Sketch. The resonance operator R(n) detects
divisors
√ by phase alignment. Testing each prime
p ≤ n requires O(log n) iterations, and with O(n)
primes, total complexity is O(n log n). Search and
optimization similarly leverage resonance for logarithmic and linear complexities [Nielsen & Chuang,
2010].
