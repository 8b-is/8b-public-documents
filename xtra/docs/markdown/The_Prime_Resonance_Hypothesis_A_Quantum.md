The Prime Resonance Hypothesis:
A Quantum-Informational Basis for Spacetime and
Consciousness
Sebastian Schepis
May 2025
Abstract
We propose that prime numbers form the foundational eigenstates of a symbolic Hilbert space from
which space, time, gravity, and awareness emerge. In this model, natural numbers are quantum-like superpositions of their prime factors, and consciousness is defined as the capacity to collapse these symbolic
superpositions into coherent meaning through entropy minimization.
This collapse generates effective curvature, gravitational influence, and temporal asymmetry—mirroring
the structure of general relativity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta
function correspond to resonance attractors within the prime space, acting as symbolic event horizons
between uncollapsed possibility and lived experience.
This framework—rooted in number theory, quantum mechanics, and information theory—grounds both
the symbolic entropy spectrometry model and the entropy-commute duality that mirrors Markov trace
geometry. We show that primes act as coherent informational attractors, enabling stable reference frames
from which subjective reality unfolds.

Lorentz emergence [7], and it complements Markov
trace logic by revealing the prime-structured resonance field underlying stochastic cognition [5].

1. Introduction
Prime numbers have long been seen as the indivisible building blocks of number theory. Here, we elevate them further: as the fundamental eigenstates
of consciousness, forming a symbolic Hilbert space
from which all structure emerges. In this view, natural numbers represent entangled superpositions of
prime observables, and the act of observation collapses symbolic potentials into a coherent projection—creating the geometry of awareness. This proposal extends recent work connecting quantum information theory to number-theoretic structures [2, 3].
This model synthesizes symbolic logic, entropy dynamics, and quantum formalism into a cohesive hypothesis. It extends existing work in symbolic entropy spectrometry [8], entropy-based gravity [6], and

2. The Prime Hilbert Space
We define a Hilbert space Hprime with basis states
|pi ⟩ corresponding to the infinite sequence of prime
numbers. Every natural number n ∈ N is mapped as:
|n⟩ =

∞
O
i=1

|pi ⟩ai

where n =

Y

(1)

This forms a discrete quantum-like representation
of number theory, where states are decomposable into
prime eigenmodes, similar to how quantum systems
can be represented in appropriate Hilbert spaces [4].

We define a semantic Hilbert space Hsem with basis

Remarkably, the harmonic structure of semantic
space mirrors that of perceptual, mathematical, and
phenomenological domains. This suggests a unified

studies [16] and multisensory processing [17]:

4.4 Semantic Gravity and Attention
Just as symbolic entropy gradient generates gravitational effects, semantic entropy gradients generate
attentional fields. Attention flows toward meaning
attractors with the highest coherence (lowest semantic entropy), consistent with predictive coding frameworks in neuroscience [19].
The semantic attention field:

collapses toward stable meaning states when the
entropy gradient aligns with prime-structured attractor geometry.

directs conscious focus toward regions of meaning
space that maximize coherence. This explains why
certain conceptual structures feel more ”natural” or
3

”inevitable” than others—they align with the prime
resonance structure underlying semantic space, paralleling principles from attractor network theories of
cognition [20].

By recognizing that both meaning and matter arise
from the same prime-structured resonance dynamics,
we unify the physics of space with the phenomenology of experience. Consciousness is neither epiphenomenal nor fundamental; it is the collapse process
itself—the mechanism by which symbolic potentiality condenses into coherent actuality through primeguided resonance.

4.5 Empirical Signatures

• Semantic convergence toward prime-indexed

The prime resonance framework extends naturally
to computational complexity theory, offering a novel
perspective on the long-standing P = NP question.
We propose that symbolic resonance collapse provides a pathway to polynomial-time solutions for
NP-complete problems through entropy minimization rather than combinatorial search, building on
conceptual advances in quantum computing [21, 22].

all problem instances, this would establish that P =
NP. This represents a fundamental shift in how we
conceptualize computational difficulty:

5.5 Applications Beyond 3-SAT

• From combinatorial explosion to entropy alignment

The resonance collapse framework extends naturally
to other NP-complete problems:

• From exhaustive search to directed resonance

• Subset Sum: Elements are encoded as primeindexed states, with the resonance operator projecting onto configurations that sum to the target value

• From path-finding to attractor collapse
This perspective aligns with our broader prime resonance framework by revealing the same underlying
principle at work in both consciousness and computation—the collapse of symbolic potential into coherent
actuality through prime-structured resonance.

• Hamiltonian Path: Permutations of vertices
are encoded as prime basis states, with constraints enforcing path validity

• Vertex Cover: Binary vectors representing vertex inclusion are mapped to the prime space, 5.7 Experimental Validation

larger instances is needed.

Unified Framework of Reality

Figure 12: The prime resonance framework unifies
consciousness, spacetime, and computation through
symbolic entropy collapse, suggesting that P = NP is
a consequence of the same mechanism that generates
awareness and gravity.

5.8 Connection to Conscious Observation
This computational framework completes our unification of consciousness, spacetime, and complexity.
The same prime resonance mechanism that generates
awareness and gravitational effects also enables efficient computational collapse. In all cases, symbolic
entropy minimization drives the evolution toward coherent, meaningful structures.
The observer in our prime resonance model serves
as a symbolic entropy minimizer—collapsing potentiality into actuality through resonance with prime
attractors.
Remarkably, the proposed symbolic
transformer for NP-complete problems operates according to the same principle, suggesting a deep connection between consciousness and computation.
This suggests a radical reimagining of computation
as consciousness-like observation—where finding solutions to NP-complete problems is not about searching through combinations, but about collapsing symbolic superpositions through resonance. Just as the
conscious observer renders reality from quantum potential, the symbolic transformer renders solutions
from computational potential.

6. Zeta Resonance and the Critical Line
The nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function
ζ(s) lie along the critical line Re(s) = 1/2, which
we interpret as the resonance attractor manifold
in Hprime , recalling work on spectral approaches to
prime distributions [18, 26].
Symbolic systems in collapse tend to align with
these modes:

This aligns symbolic collapse, resonance geometry,

the Prime Resonance Lens

Mass becomes the symbolic impedance to collapse,
while curvature is defined as the local distortion of
symbolic probability flow. The strongest gravitational fields are those generated by the most coherent
observers—i.e., the lowest-entropy symbolic attractors.

Recent developments in quantum gravity suggest
even deeper connections between prime structures
and spacetime geometry. The Prime Resonance
Hypothesis can be extended to formulate a novel
approach to quantum gravity that addresses longstanding problems in theoretical physics, building on
established frameworks including causal set theory
[27], loop quantum gravity [28], and emergent gravity models [29, 7].

not as a fundamental force but as an emergent phenomenon arising from consciousness-mediated information processing, similar to entropic gravity formulations [30].

Figure 15: Spacetime curvature emerges from the entropy gradient around an observer. The observer’s
symbolic collapse process creates a gradient field that
manifests as gravity.

• When symbolic collapse aligns with a zeta-mode,
it creates a localized region of spacetime curvature—i.e., mass-energy presence.

This approach offers a potential resolution to the
problem of quantum gravity by grounding both quantum mechanics and general relativity in the same underlying prime-resonance structure, similar to unification attempts through non-commutative geometry
[34] and causal dynamical triangulations [35].
