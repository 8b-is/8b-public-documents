CONSCIOUSNESS, FREE WILL AND QUANTUM
BRAIN BIOLOGY – THE ‘ORCH OR’ THEORY1a
Stuart Hameroff * b

1. Introduction – Consciousness and its place in the
universe
We know what it is like to be conscious – to have awareness,
phenomenal experience (composed of what philosophers term ‘qualia’), a
sense of ‘self ’, feelings, sensations, emotions, apparent choice and control
of actions, memory, a model of the world and one’s body, thought,
language, and, e.g. when we close our eyes, or meditate, internallygenerated images and geometric patterns. But what consciousness actually
is, how it comes about and its place in the universe remain unknown.
Science generally portrays consciousness as an emergent property of
complex computation among brain neurons. In this view, consciousness
first appeared during evolution of biological nervous systems. On the other
hand, some philosophical, spiritual and quantum physical approaches
suggest consciousness depends on a fundamental property intrinsic to the
universe, and that consciousness has, in some sense, been in the universe
all along. Could both views be true?
The very existence of consciousness seems highly unlikely.
Cosmologists tell us that if specific values for the twenty or so fundamental
numbers which characterize the universe (precise charge and mass of
particles, values for gravitational and other constants, etc.) were just
slightly different, life and consciousness—at least as we know them—
would be impossible. The universe is seemingly ‘fine-tuned’ for life and

consciousness. Why this may be so is approached by several versions of the
‘anthropic principle’. In the ‘strong’ version (Barrow, and Tipler 1986),
the universe is somehow compelled to harbor and enable consciousness,
as if consciousness were engaged in its development, organizing the
universe. The ‘weak anthropic principle’ (Carter, 1974) suggests that
only our particular universe is capable of consciousness, and only this
one universe, a privileged version of a multitude of universes, can be
observed and wondered about. The question again boils down to whether
consciousness is intrinsic to the universe, or an emergent property of
brain computation.
The conventional wisdom in neuroscience and philosophy tells us
consciousness emerges from brain computation, specifically complex
synaptic computation among ‘integrate-and-fire’ (‘Hodgkin-Huxley’)
brain neurons. The foundation for attempts to understand consciousness
is that the brain is a computer. Consciousness is a computation. Some
proponents further believe that when the brain’s computational wiring
diagram—the ‘connectome’—is unraveled, mapped and replicated in
silicon, brain functions including consciousness will be downloaded and
recreated (Kurzweil, 2013). Consciousness would become a commodity.
Huge resources are aimed at ‘mapping the brain’.
But consciousness isn’t necessarily computation. Physicist Sir Roger
Penrose (1989) points out that while computers surpass humans in
many information capacities, they don’t really ‘understand’ anything.
And as philosopher David Chalmers’ (1996) ‘hard problem’ illustrates,
phenomenal ‘qualia’ like redness, joy, the taste of mustard and the smell
of lilac may involve some added feature, some ‘funda-mental’ entity or
process intrinsic to the fine scale structure of the universe, akin to mass,
spin or charge, perhaps embedded with fundamental values which work
to anthropically optimize the universe for consciousness.
Unable to account for consciousness through strictly neuronal
computational approaches, prominent neuroscientist Christof Koch
(2012) has appealed to panpsychism, the notion that material particles
are endowed with subjectivity, or experiential ‘qualia’, intrinsic to
the universe as a property of matter. But matter itself, at tiny scales, is
continuously ‘materializing’, i.e. reducing, or collapsing to definite states
from multiple quantum possibilities. At the scale at which biomolecules

146

STUART HAMEROFF

govern neuronal activity, the strange laws of quantum mechanics come
into play, and materialism is a mirage. Consciousness seems related to the
boundary between quantum and material worlds.
Physical reality is ruled by two sets of seemingly incompatible laws.
In our everyday material (‘classical’) world, Newton’s laws of motion,
Maxwell’s equations, the gas laws and others accurately predict behavior
of particles and energy. However at tiny scales, and the size cutoff, or
boundary between the two worlds is variable and unknown, the laws of
quantum mechanics rule. Particles can exist in multiple locations or states
simultaneously (‘quantum superposition’), become spatially separated
from one another, but remain connected (‘entanglement’), and condense
into unitary objects (‘quantum coherence’).
This strangeness isn’t observed in our material world. Attempts to
measure quantum superpositions cause them to collapse to definite states.
The mystery of why this happens, why there exists some boundary, or
edge between quantum and classical worlds is known as the ‘measurement
problem’ in quantum mechanics.
Several interesting solutions to the measurement problem have been
put forth. Decoherence is the notion that quantum systems which interact
with the classical environment are disrupted by thermal interactions.
What about isolated quantum systems?
One proposal from the early days of quantum mechanics is that
the very act of conscious observation causes quantum possibilities to
materialize, or reduce to definite states - consciousness ‘collapses the wave
function’ (e.g. Wigner, von Neumann, Stapp). This view is also known as
the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’ due to the Danish origin of Niels Bohr,
one of its early proponents. But this view led to a major dilemma about
unobserved, isolated quantum systems, as illustrated by Schrödinger’s
famous thought experiment in which the fate of an isolated cat is tied
to a quantum superposition. According to Copenhagen, the cat is both
dead and alive until observed by a conscious human. Absurd it was, but
the question persists. Why aren’t quantum superpositions seen in our
material world?
The ‘multiple worlds’ hypothesis suggests that with each superposition,
the universe separates at a fundamental level, each possibility evolving
into its own universe (Everett, 1957). Thus there exists an infinite number

147

LECTURES

of co-existing, ‘parallel universes’. This view has been linked to the weak
anthropic principle, in which we live in the one universe, of a multitude
of universes, most conducive to life and consciousness.
These approaches are flawed. But each may each hold part of an answer.
The Copenhagen/conscious observer approach has its Schrödinger’s cat
problem, and places consciousness outside science as the external cause
of collapse/reduction. But it does directly link consciousness to quantum
state reduction.
‘Multiple worlds’ is untestable, non-falsifiable, energetically
unfavorable, and doesn’t deal with consciousness. But it does deal with
the nature of superposition. It implies that a particle in two places at
the same time is equivalent to separation, bifurcation, in the fine scale
structure of the universe—spacetime geometry (irrespective of whether
the separated spacetimes evolve to their own universes). Each particle
location has its own spacetime geometry.
Another proposed solution to the measurement problem with
concepts similar to these two features is Penrose ‘objective reduction’ (OR)
in which quantum superpositions evolve by the Schrödinger equation
until reaching an ‘objective’ threshold for reduction, or collapse. Similar
to ‘multiple worlds’, Penrose OR portrays quantum superpositions as
spacetime separations (due to alternate curvatures), but are unstable due
to properties inherent in spacetime geometry. Before each spacetime
branch evolves its own new universe, the separation reaches OR threshold
by the uncertainty principle EG = h/t (EG is the magnitude of separation,
h is the Planck-Dirac constant, and t the time at which OR occurs).
At that instant, spacetime geometry reconfigures, quantum possibilities
choose particular material states, and, according to Penrose, a moment
of conscious experience occurs. Penrose OR turns the Copenhagen/
conscious observer approach around. Rather than consciousness causing
collapse/reduction, consciousness is collapse/reduction, a process on the
edge between quantum and classical worlds.
Generally, OR can be taken as equivalent to decoherence, the
process by which a quantum system is said to be disrupted by its random
environment. Superposition/separations EG arising continuously will
entangle other such random superpositions and quickly reach OR
threshold by EG = h/t. In such cases, the conscious experience would be

148

STUART HAMEROFF

primitive qualia without cognitive meaning, described as ‘proto-conscious’,
intrinsic to the universe, accompanying OR events ubiquitously shaping
material reality. This approach is similar to the ‘Ground of Being’ concept
in Eastern philosophical terms.
OR ‘protoconscious moments’ are also similar to Buddhist concepts
of discrete conscious moments, and to an approach to consciousness as
‘occasions of experience’ by philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1929,
1933) who saw consciousness, and the universe, as a process, as sequences
of events. Leibniz (1768) had ‘quantized’ reality, describing fundamental
‘monads’ as ultimate entities, but Whitehead transformed monads
into ‘actual occasions’ occurring in a “basic field of proto-conscious
experience”. Whitehead occasions of experience are intrinsic to the
universe, spatiotemporal quanta, each endowed, usually, with only low
level, “dull, monotonous, and repetitious […] mentalistic characteristics”.
Abner Shimony (1993) observed how Whitehead ‘occasions’ resemble
quantum state reductions.
How do we get from simple proto-conscious moments, or occasions,
to full, rich meaningful consciousness? In panpsychism, simple particles
with simple experience must be somehow organized, or combined into
a cognitive, meaningful arrangement—the ‘combination problem’.
Whitehead considered this problem for his ‘occasions’, or events, rather than
particles, and described how ‘highly organized societies of occasions permit
primitive mentality to become intense, coherent and fully conscious’.
How can Penrose OR events be so organized, and occur in the context
of brain function? The Penrose-Hameroff ‘Orch OR’ theory suggests OR
events are ‘orchestrated’ into full, rich conscious moments. This paper
describes how Orch OR can occur in structures called microtubules
inside brain neurons, how it addresses the particular issue of free will,
and discusses ‘brain tuning’, the possibility of addressing mental states
and disorders through microtubule quantum vibrations. Consciousness
is seen as intrinsic to the universe.

2. Where in the brain does consciousness occur?

Figure 1. Three waves in sensory processing. Sensory inputs from spinal cord and cranial nerves
to thalamus result in primary projections (1) to primary sensory cortex, e.g. visual area 1 (V1) in
occipital cortex in the back of the brain. From these areas, feed-forward projections (2) go to secondary
associative and ‘executive’ areas cortex, e.g. pre-frontal cortex (PFC) from which tertiary projections (3)
go to other brain regions whose content then becomes conscious.

The general architecture for conscious sensory processing in the brain
is shown in Figure 1. Sensory inputs to thalamus result in (1) projections
to primary sensory cortex, e.g. visual area 1 (V1) in occipital cortex in the
back of the brain. From primary sensory areas, (2) secondary feed-forward
projections go to associative and ‘executive’ e.g. pre-frontal cortex (PFC).
From there, (3) tertiary projections go to other cortical regions whose
content then becomes conscious.
The notion that this ‘third wave’ feedback is conscious, and first and second
waves are not conscious, is consistent with philosophical approaches called
‘higher order thought’ (‘HOT’), and neuroscientific cortical feedback models
for conscious vision Lamme & Roelfsma, 2000). Experimental evidence for
the association of the ‘third wave’ with consciousness is provided through
studies of anesthesia. Despite the fact that neurotransmitters, receptors and
other neurophysiology appears identical among the three waves, all three
types of anesthetic molecules (volatile gas anesthetics, propofol and ketamine)
selectively inhibit third wave activity while sparing primary and secondary
projections (Lee et al, 2013).
There are two clarifications with this anatomical scheme. First,
although the brain’s medial surface is shown in Figure 3, sensory-based

150

STUART HAMEROFF

cortical projections may occur more toward outer dorsal surfaces. Second,
internally-generated conscious states, e.g. mindwandering, meditation
and dreams, possibly mediated through default mode networks, will have
different pathways, though their end targets (layer V cortical pyramidal
neurons, see below) may be identical.
Third wave activity within cortex seems to also be composed of three
waves, successively, and maximally, integrating information. Cortex is
arranged in 6 horizontal layers, and sensory inputs from thalamus go
(1) to layer 4, and thence (2) from layer 4 to layers 1, 2, 3 and 6. (3)
Projections from these layers converge on layer 5 giant pyramidal neurons,
the most likely site for consciousness in the brain. Apical dendrites from
pyramidal neurons ascend vertically to the cortical surface, and are most
directly responsible for measurable electro-encephalography (EEG), e.g.
‘40 Hz’ gamma synchrony, the best neural correlate of consciousness.
Axonal firing outputs from layer V pyramidal neurons descend, e.g. to
implement behavior, exerting causal efficacy in the world. Third wave
integration in cortical layer V pyramidal neurons is the most likely site
for consciousness in the brain.

Figure 2. Three waves of sensory processing in cerebral cortex, a thin mantle on the very top of
the brain composed of 6 hierarchical cellular layers. Primary sensory projections from thalamus (1)
arrive in layer IV which projects secondary activity (2) to layers I, II, III and VI. These areas then project
tertiary (3) activity to giant pyramidal neurons in layer V, where consciousness is most likely to occur.
Outputs from layer V pyramidal neurons project sub-cortically, e.g. to manifest ‘conscious’ behavioral
actions. Activity in apical dendrites from pyramidal neurons which ascend to cortical surface are most
directly responsible for measurable electro-encephalography (EEG).

LECTURES

Figure 3. Layer V pyramidal neuron with internal networks of microtubules connected by
microtubule-associated proteins (‘MAPs’). Inputs from apical and basilar dendrites are integrated in
pyramidal neuronal membranes and cytoskeletal microtubules. On left, a single microtubule is shown
comprised of individual tubulin proteins, each in 3 possible states.

‘Integrate-and-fire’ layer V pyramidal neurons are the final, and
maximal, integrator for sensory processing, providing a neurobiological
basis for ‘Integrated information theory’ (Tononi, 2012). Their firing
outputs control behavior, but neuroscience considers pyramidal neurons
(indeed all neurons) according to the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) standard
model. In HH, each neuron is a threshold logic device in which dendrites
and cell body (soma) receive and integrate synaptic inputs via excitatory
and inhibitory membrane potentials to a threshold at the proximal axon
(axon hillock, or axon initiation segment— ‘AIS’). When AIS membrane
potential reaches a critical threshold, the axon ‘fires’ to convey signals to
the next synapse and layer of neurons.
Integration implies merging and consolidation of multiple disparate
information sources. At the level of an individual neuron, integration
is approximated as linear summation of synaptic membrane potentials.
However integration in branching dendrites and soma requires logic,
amplification of distal inputs, branch point effects, and signaling in
dendritic spines and local dendritic regions. Nonetheless, according to
HH, all such factors are reflected in membrane potentials, and thus the
HH neuron is completely algorithmic and deterministic. For a given
set of inputs, synaptic strengths and firing threshold, a fixed output in

152

STUART HAMEROFF

the form of axonal firings, or spikes will occur. Networks of integrateand-fire neurons regulated by synaptic strengths and firing thresholds
can integrate at various anatomical scales, providing highly nonlinear
functional processing. But in the end, such processes are algorithmic and
deterministic, leaving no apparent room for consciousness or free will.

Figure 4. Integrate-and-fire neuronal behaviors. a. The Hodgkin-Huxley model predicts
integration by membrane potential in dendrites and soma reach a specific, narrow threshold potential
at the proximal axon (AIS) and fire with very low temporal variability (small tb-ta) for given inputs.
b. Recordings from cortical neurons in awake animals (Naundorf et al. 2006) show a large variability
in effective firing threshold and timing. Some additional factor, perhaps related to consciousness (‘C’)
exerts causal influence on firing and behavior.

However, real neurons differ from idealized HH neurons. For
example Naundorf et al. (2006) showed that firing threshold in cortical
neurons in brains of awake animals vary spike-to-spike. Some factor other
than inputs, synaptic strengths and the integrated membrane potential at
the AIS contributes to firing, or not firing. Firings control behavior. This
integration ‘x-factor’ deviation from HH behavior, modulating integration
and adjusting firing threshold e.g. in layer V pyramidal neurons, is perfectly
positioned for consciousness, causal action and free will, yet is in some
way divorced from membrane potentials. What might it be?
3. A finer scale?
Interiors of neurons and other cells are organized and shaped by
the cytoskeleton, a scaffolding-like protein network of microtubules,
microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), actin and intermediate filaments.

Microtubules (MTs) are cylindrical polymers 25 nanometers
(nm = 10-9 meter) in diameter, comprised usually of 13 longitudinal
protofilaments, each chains of the protein tubulin. MTs self-assemble
from the peanut-shaped tubulin, a ferroelectric dipole arranged within
microtubules in two types of hexagonal lattices (A-lattice and B-lattice),
each slightly twisted, resulting in differing neighbor relationships among
each subunit and its six nearest neighbors. Pathways along contiguous
tubulins in the A-lattice form helical pathways which repeat every 3, 5
and 8 rows on any protofilament (the Fibonacci series).
Each tubulin may differ from among its neighbors by genetic
variability, post-translational modifications, phosphorylation states,
binding of ligands and MAPs, and dipole orientation. MTs are particularly
prevalent in neurons (109 tubulins/neuron), and uniquely suitable,
especially in dendrites and cell bodies, for information processing,
encoding and memory. In cell division, MTs dis-assemble, and then
re-assemble as mitotic spindles, which separate chromosomes, establish
daughter cell polarity and then re-assemble for cellular structure and
function. However neurons are unlike other cells; once formed, they
don’t divide, and so neuronal MTs may remain assembled indefinitely,
providing a stable potential medium for memory encoding.
MTs in neuronal soma and dendrites are unique in other ways as
well. Each tubulin dimer (composed of slightly different alpha and beta
monomers) has a dipole, a net positive charge at the beta monomer, and
a net negative charge at the alpha monomer. So MTs assembled from
parallel arrayed tubulin dipoles also have a net dipole, positive toward
its beta monomer end, and negative toward the alpha end. In axons, and
in all non-neuronal cells throughout biology, MTs are arrayed radially,
like spokes in a wheel, extending continuously from the centrosome near
the nucleus, outward toward the cell membrane. These radially arrayed
MTs all have the same polarity, the beta plus end outward toward the cell
membrane, and alpha negative end inward at the hub, anchored to the
centrosome/centriole near the nucleus.
However unlike axons and all other cells, MTs in dendrites and cell
bodies/soma are short, interrupted and of mixed polarity, some with
their beta plus ends outward, and the rest inward, all interconnected by
MAPs into local networks. Dendritic-somatic MTs are also stabilized

154

STUART HAMEROFF

against depolymerization by special MAP capping proteins, and are thus
particularly suitable for memory encoding.
The mechanism by which memory is encoded, stored and processed in
the brain remains largely unknown. The standard explanation is through
synaptic plasticity, i.e. sensitivities at particular synapses guide activity and
create patterns through neuronal networks. However synaptic membrane
proteins which determine sensitivity are transient and continuously recycled, lasting only hours to days, and yet memories can last lifetimes.
Some other factor, or factors, must be involved.
Synaptic proteins are synthesized in neuronal cell bodies/soma,
and transported to synapses by ‘dynein’ and ‘kinesin’ motor proteins
traveling along MTs, which appear to act as passive guides, like railroad
tracks. In dendrites and soma where MTs are short, interrupted and of
mixed polarity, the motor proteins must jump from MT to MT, and,
at dendritic branch points, choose particular pathways to deliver their
cargo to the proper synapses. How they do so seems to depend on tau,
the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) thought to stabilize MTs, that
also seems to serve as traffic signals, instructing motor proteins precisely
where to disembark and deliver their cargo. Thus specific placement
patterns of tau on MT lattices subserves synaptic function related to
memory, and implies specific tau binding locations are encoded in MTs.
Tau displacement from MTs results in neurofibrillary tangles, microtubule
instability and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease.
Thus memory-related synaptic function depends on information
encoded in MT lattices, e.g. tau placement. As the origins of memory
must reach MTs from the outside world, the question then becomes how
synaptic-based inputs may encode information in MTs.
The prevalent synaptic model for memory is long term potentiation
(LTP) in which brief, high frequency pre-synaptic stimulation results
in long-term post-synaptic potentiation (increased synaptic sensitivity),
able to influence neuronal network patterns. At the intra-neuronal level
in LTP, synaptic excitation causes influx of calcium ions which convert
the hexagonal enzyme calcium-calmodulin to an insect-like calciumcalmodulin kinase II holoenzyme (‘CaMKII’). Each of six extended
kinase domains on either side of CaMKII are able to phosphorylate
(or not phosphorylate) suitable protein substrates, thus providing up

155

LECTURES

to 6 ‘bits’ of information per CaMKII, with hundreds to thousands
of CaMKII activation per synaptic excitation. Protein substrates for
CaMKII phosphorylations are likely sites for memory encoding, storage
and processing. What might they be?
Craddock et al (2012) showed the hexagonal CaMKII kinase
array precisely matches hexagonal tubulin lattice spatial geometry in
microtubules, and that each kinase domain can reach intra-tubulin
amino acids suitable for phosphorylation (Figure 5). CaMKII tubulin
phosphorylation may alter dynamical properties, and lead to posttranslational modifications resulting in memory ‘hardwiring’. Dendriticsomatic microtubules are likely sites for memory encoding.

Figure 5. Memory trace - Calcium-calmodulin kinase II (‘CaMKII’), a hexagonal holoenzyme
activated by synaptic calcium influx extends 6 leg-like kinase domains above and below an association
domain. The 6 kinase domains precisely match hexagonal size and geometry in both A-lattice and
B-lattice microtubules.

Due to their lattice structure and organizational roles, MTs have long
been suggested to function as information processing devices. Observing
and wondering at the intelligent behavior of single cell organisms
(lacking synapses), famed biologist Charles Sherrington said (1957):
“of nerve there is no trace, but the cytoskeleton might serve”. Early
descriptions of MTs as computer-like devices (Hameroff, and Watt 1982;
Hameroff 1997; Rasmussen et al. 1990) suggested that (1) individual
tubulins act as binary bit-like information units (e.g. flexing between
two conformations, or dipole states), and that (2) the microtubule lattice
acted as a computational matrix or cellular (‘molecular’) automata. In the
latter case, tubulin states interact with hexagonal lattice neighbor tubulin
states by dipole couplings, synchronized by biomolecular coherence as
proposed by Fröhlich (1968, 1970, 1975; Smith et al. 1984, Rasmussen
et al. 1990). Simulations of microtubule automata based on tubulin
states show rapid information integration and learning. If the MT
memory proposal is correct, information processing relevant to cognition

and consciousness would be occurring precisely in the medium in which
memory is embedded, a highly efficient and logical proposition.
Figure 6. Three time-steps (e.g. at 10 megahertz) of two types of microtubule automata. (a) Dipole
paths or spin currents interact and compute along spiral lattice pathways, for example generating a new
vertical spinwave (a ‘glider gun’ in cellular automata). (b) A general microtubule automata process.

Models of MT information processing developed in the 1980s and
1990s considered fundamental information units to be a bit-like binary
state of an individual tubulin, interacting/computing with states of its
six surrounding tubulin lattice neighbors. However, subsequent models
have considered, instead, topological pathways of like tubulin states
through two types of MT lattice geometry. In the A lattice with Fibonacci
geometry (Figure 7), pathways through adjacent tubulins follow pathways

157

LECTURES

which (1) travel upward/rightward, repeating every 5 tubulins on any
single protofilament, and another upward/leftward, repeating every 8
tubulins. Dipole orientations along these pathways may also represent
information, interact and compute, perhaps coupled to MT vibrations
along these pathways.
In any case, MT-based information processing implies enormous
capacity and speed. Based on tubulin binary switching and 10 megahertz
processing (see below), MT-based information capacity is roughly 109
tubulins per neuron oscillating at e.g. 10 megahertz (107 Hz) for 1016
operations per second per neuron.

or magnetic dipoles, e.g. related to electronic (and/or nuclear) spin. Similar qubit pathways may occur
along 8-start pathways, or other pathways.

Dendritic-somatic MTs regulate synapses in several ways. They
serve as tracks and guides for motor proteins (dynein and kinesin)
which transport synaptic precursors from cell body to distal synapses,
encountering, and choosing among several dendritic branch points and
many MTs to find the right location. The navigational guidance seems
to involve the MAP tau as a ‘traffic signal’ (specific placement of tau
on microtubules being the critical feature). In Alzheimer’s disease, tau
is hyperphosphorylated and dislodged from destabilized microtubules,
forming neurofibrillary tangles associated with memory loss (Matsuyama
& Jarvik, 1989; Craddock et al., 2012a). In Downs syndrome dementia,
post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and other cognitive
disorders, MTs are also destabilized and partially disrupted.
Information integration in dendritic-somatic MTs, influenced by
encoded memory, may cause deviation from Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal

159

LECTURES

behavior, exerting causal agency. A deeper order, high capacity, finer scale
process, e.g. at end-integration in cortical layer V pyramidal neuron
dendritic-somatic MTs is a likely site for consciousness. But such a process
would still be algorithmic, deterministic, and fail to address phenomenal
experience—the ‘hard problem’. Something is still missing. Penrose OR
provides non-algorithmic (non-computable) processing, causality and
addresses the hard problem. In the mid-1990s, Penrose and Hameroff
teamed up to apply OR to biology, specifically OR-terminated quantum
computations in brain neuronal MTs ‘orchestrated’ by synaptic inputs,
memory and intrinsic MT resonances.
4. Penrose ‘Objective Reduction’ (‘OR’) and the ‘Orch
OR’ qubit
Penrose OR is one proposed solution to the ‘measurement problem’
in quantum mechanics, the problem of why quantum superpositions—
particles existing in multiple states or locations at the same time, and
described by a quantum wave function—are restricted to microscopic
scales, not seen in the ‘classical’ world we experience. Other suggestions
include (1) proposals by Bohr, Wigner, von Neumann, Stapp and others
(the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’, after Niels Bohr’s Danish origin) in
which conscious observation causes the wave function to collapse (e.g.
Schrödinger’s cat), but putting consciousness outside science, and (2)
decoherence, which suggests that interaction with the random, classical
environment disrupts quantum states. (3) ‘Multiple worlds’ (Everett,
1957) proposes that each possibility evolves its own spacetime geometry,
resulting in an infinite number of co-existing universes. And (4), objective
reduction (OR) models specify thresholds for quantum state reduction.
Among these is Penrose OR.

particle location is equivalent to spacetime curvature. Left: Top and bottom show spacetime histories
of two alternative particle locations. Right: Quantum superposition of both particle locations as
bifurcating space–time depicted as the union (‘glued together version’) of the two alternative histories
(adapted from Penrose 1989, 338).

To approach superposition, Roger Penrose first equated particle states
to particular curvatures in spacetime geometry, and superposition to
simultaneous, alternate curvatures. Superposition may then be seen as a
Planck scale separation, or bubble in the fine scale structure of the universe
(Figure 1). In the ‘multiple worlds’ proposal, each such possible curvature
would evolve its own universe. However Penrose suggested spacetime
separations were unstable, and would reduce (collapse) due to an objective
threshold given by a form of the uncertainty principle EG=h/t. EG is
the gravitational self-energy of the superposition, h is the Planck-Dirac
constant, and t the time at which OR occurs, accompanied by a conscious
moment, and selecting particular states of reality (Figure 2).

Figure 10. As superposition curvature EG reaches threshold (by EG = h/t), OR occurs. One
particle location/curvature is selected and becomes classical. The other ceases to exist.

Generally, such OR events occur in a random environment (identical
to decoherence), the accompanying subjective experience lacking cognitive

161

LECTURES

function or meaning. The Penrose-Hameroff ‘Orch OR’ theory proposes
that biology evolved specific mechanisms to isolate and ‘orchestrate’
OR events (‘orchestrated objective reduction’ - ‘Orch OR’), giving full,
rich conscious experience with cognitive meaning and volitional choice.
Specific Orch OR mechanisms involve a form of quantum computing
in the brain, specifically via structures called microtubules found in all
animal and plant cells.
In quantum computers, information is represented not just as, e.g.,
binary bits of 1 or 0, but also as quantum superposition (quantum bits,
or ‘qubits’) of both 1 and 0. Qubits can entangle, interact and compute
with other qubits non-locally, and highly efficiently, according to the
Schrödinger equation. (In topological quantum computing, qubits
are states of particular pathways through lattices, rather than states of
individual subunits comprising those pathways.)
Two basic issues limit implementation of quantum computers.
First, interaction with the classical environment disrupts the quantum
superposition (‘decoherence’), and must be avoided long enough for
useful computation to occur. Laboratory quantum computers are
hampered by decoherence due to the ‘random’ thermal environment, and
thus constructed at extremely cold temperatures. (Topological qubits are
more resistant to decoherence.)
Conceptually, Penrose OR by E = h/t replaces decoherence. Without
isolation, in a random environment, OR occurs rapidly, with random
outcomes. The combined EG of the system and its environment
quickly reach threshold at h/t, and OR occurs with a non-cognitive,
random moment of subjective experience. Presumably, this is occurring
continuously, ubiquitously, throughout the universe.
If, however, superposition EG is isolated from the random
environment, ‘orchestrated’ in a computational register (e.g. a microtubule)
by inputs, memory and resonances, and follows the Schrödinger equation
to perform cognitive quantum computing, then the orchestrated process
will reach OR threshold by EG = h/t, with EG being composed entirely of
orchestrated states. Orch OR then occurs with meaningful cognition and
full, rich conscious experience. Sequences of such Orch OR conscious
moments provide our familiar ‘stream of consciousness’. Tubulin states
selected in each Orch OR event (e.g. in layer V pyramidal neuron soma

162

STUART HAMEROFF

and dendrites) can exert influence on triggering, or not triggering, axonal
firing. Orch OR can be the source of ‘conscious’ deviation from HodgkinHuxley behavior.
Orch OR also directly addresses the second issue hampering
technological quantum computing, akin to the ‘halting problem’ in
classical computing. If EG is isolated, premature OR/decoherence is
avoided, and the quantum computation proceeds, what then stops it to
cause reduction, or collapse to a set of classical values as the solution?
In technological quantum computers, the isolated quantum process
must, at some point, be ‘measured’, i.e. the system is observed, causing
environmental decoherence, collapse or premature OR. This introduces
randomness, and some quantum computers are intended to run the
same process repeatedly to average out randomness in measurement/
decoherence.
Orch OR offers a direct solution, the quantum computation ‘halting’
by an objective threshold E = h/t. Moreover the specific states (conscious
perceptions, actions, tubulin dipoles) selected in each Orch OR event
are not randomly chosen, but a product of the quantum computation
influenced at the instant of Orch OR by ‘non-computable’ Platonic
factors inherent in spacetime geometry.
Orch OR thus proposes a conscious connection between brain
biology and behavior, and the fine scale structure of spacetime geometry
through the gravitational self-energy EG of the superposition separation
of tubulin in EG = h/t.
According to Orch OR, tubulin states are governed by electronic
(and perhaps magnetic) dipoles in non-polar electron clouds, such as
aromatic resonance rings of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. 32
such rings occur in tubulin, aligned in ‘quantum channels’, which may
align with those in neighboring tubulins, and pathways, in the MT lattice
(Figures 7 & 8). These same quantum channels are where anesthetic gas
molecules bind by weak, quantum-level London forces to selectively erase
consciousness, sparing non-conscious processes. Superposition of tubulin
dipole orientations may enable tubulins to act as qubits, and helical
pathways through microtubules to act as topological qubits. But electrons
have extremely low mass, and EG for their superposition separation would
be very small, requiring extremely long values of t.

163

LECTURES

However, electron movements of one nanometer shift nearby
atomic nuclei by femtometers (Mossbauer recoil and charge attraction),
so superposition of electron cloud dipole orientations should result in
femtometer superposition separation in tubulin atomic nuclei, sufficient
for significant EG and brief t.
EG for tubulin superposition separation in Orch OR was calculated
in three ways: (1) as separation of 10% of the protein dimer length (~1
nanometer), (2) as separation at the level of the atomic nuclei within
each atom of tubulin (femtometer, 10-15 meter for carbon), and (3) as
separation at the level of nucleons, i.e. protons and neutrons within
nuclei (10-16 m). The dominant effect was determined to occur at (2)
femtometer separation at the level of atomic nuclei. This implies
electronic (or magnetic) dipole movements and superpositions in intratubulin ‘quantum channel’ electron cloud resonance rings correspond
with femtometer movements and superpositions of nearby atomic nuclei.
Gravitational self-energy EG of a superpositioned tubulin is then
given by EG = Gm2/ac where G is the gravitational constant, and ac is the
superposition separation distance, a carbon nucleus sphere radius equal
to 2.5 fermi distances (2.5 femtometers, 2.5 x 10-15 meter). If t is assumed
to correspond with a neurophysiological event, say 40 Hz gamma
synchrony EEG (the best neural correlate of consciousness), then EG is
calculated to be roughly 1010 tubulins. With 109 tubulins per neuron,
estimating 0.1% tubulins as quantum coherent (the percent of quantum
active molecules in superconductors), requiring 10,000 neurons for t
= 25 msec gamma synchrony. But premature OR/decoherence would
need to be avoided for 25 msec, a long time in the seemingly ‘warm wet
and noisy’ intra-neuronal environment. Indeed, quantum approaches
to brain biology and consciousness have seemed unlikely because of
environmental decoherence.
Physicist Max Tegmark (2000) published a critique of Orch OR based
on a formula he developed which calculated microtubule decoherence at
brain temperature to occur at time tau of 10−13 seconds, far from 25 msec.
But something was rotten in Tegmark’s formula for tau, specifically a
term in the denominator for superposition separation. In Orch OR, this
is the femtometer diameter of atomic nuclei, however Tegmark described
a superpositioned soliton separated from itself by 24 nanometers (3

164

STUART HAMEROFF

tubulin lengths) along the microtubule. This gave a decoherence time
tau 7 orders of magnitude smaller than it should have been, i.e. from
10−13 sec to 10−6 sec. Hagan et al. (2001) used Tegmark’s same formula,
correcting for Orch OR stipulations (superposition separation distance,
permittivity etc.) and recalculated microtubule decoherence times to
be 10−4 sec, suggesting topological resonances would sustain quantum
coherence in microtubules for 10-1 to 10-2 sec. Tegmark’s critique, and
Hagan et al.’s reply, pitted theory versus theory.
In 2006, experimental research began to show that photosynthesis,
the mechanism in plants by which sunlight is converted to chemical
energy for food, and without which life could not exist, utilizes quantum
coherence at ambient temperatures, i.e. in sunlight. Energy from each
photon absorbed in one region of a plant cellular complex is transported
as electronic excitations (‘excitons’) to another region of the complex
through a series of ‘chromophores’, light-absorbing molecules composed
of electron resonance clouds. What was surprising—stunning, really—
was that the excitons propagated through the chromophores by all
possible pathways, essentially a quantum superposition of excitonic
pathways. Further work suggested the quantum coherent superposition
was aided by coupling to mechanical vibrations in the protein complex.
But because the propagation distance was so short, i.e. a few nanometers
within the cellular complex, the coherence persisted only for very brief
periods of time, e.g. femtoseconds.
What about microtubules? Using nanotechnology, the group of Anirban
Bandyopadhyay at the National Institute of Material Science in Tsukuba,
Japan was able to apply 4 electrodes to a single MT at room temperature. Two
electrodes were used to apply very low levels of alternating current (AC) at
varying frequencies, and the other two electrodes used to record conductance
through the MT. Without AC stimulation, MTs were non-conductive, their
resistance extremely high. However at a number of applied AC frequencies
across a wide spectrum (gigahertz, megahertz, and as low as 10 kilohertz),
MT resistance dropped, and the MT became significantly conductive (Sahu
et al. 2013a, 2013b). More recent studies using nanoprobes inside active
neurons also show megahertz and kilohertz coherent vibrations. Particular
resonant frequencies may correlate with conductance and vibrations along
specific helical pathways through MT lattices.

165

LECTURES

Quantum resonances as low as 10 kilohertz indicate MT coherence
times as long as 10-4 seconds, the same MT coherence time calculated by
Hagan et al. (2001) using Orch OR stipulations. If t in EG = h/t is set to
10-4 secs, EG of tubulins in 10 million neurons would be required. For
10-7 secs, 10 MHz (also proven) EG of tubulins in 10 billion neurons (or
higher involvement per neuron) would be required. Indeed, Orch OR
may be seen to occur at different frequency ranges, e.g. akin to different
scales in music. But t = 10-4 secs is still too brief for physiological effects,
such as gamma synchrony EEG at 25 msec.
In Hameroff and Penrose (2014) it was proposed that EEG rhythms
are ‘beat frequencies’ of faster oscillations in microtubules. For example
MT megahertz vibrations of slightly different frequencies, or energies,
would interfere to give much slower ‘beats’, e.g. in the 1 to 100 Hz
range seen in EEG. Indeed, consciousness may be more like music than
computation, sequences of events, at different frequencies, in some cases
harmonically related. Quantum vibrations in brain MTs punctuated
by Orch OR events are also ripples, or rearrangements in fundamental
spacetime geometry. Orch OR connects conscious brain activities to
processes in the fine scale structure of the universe.
Each Orch OR conscious moment, e.g. occurring in dendritic-somatic
MTs in layer V cortical pyramidal neurons, also selects tubulin states which
govern neuronal activities including axonal firing, thus exerting causal action
and conscious control of behavior. Can Orch OR account for free will?
5. Free will - Is consciousness too late?
Free will implies conscious agency – that ‘we’ have conscious causal
control and choice of our actions. Indeed, ‘we’ do seem to have conscious
control, but do we really? First, who, or what exactly is ‘we’, or ‘I’? There
is no agreed-upon mechanism for consciousness nor conscious agency in
neuroscience and philosophy. However Orch OR does offer a mechanism
for conscious causal action – tubulin states selected in each Orch OR
event may trigger, or not trigger, axonal firings to implement behavior
(deviation from Hodgkin-Huxley).
A second issue involves determinism, the notion that all processes in
the world, and in our minds, are algorithmic and our choices inevitable

166

STUART HAMEROFF

and predetermined, with perhaps a dash of randomness. Determinism
implies that conscious perceptions and actions follow a complex script
written by the laws of nature and history of the universe. Penrose OR
avoids determinism by ‘non-computable’, non-algorithmic influence on
selection of particular states at the instant of reduction. According to OR,
the quantum wave function of superposition EG evolves algorithmically
according to the Schrödinger equation up until the moment of OR at
time t (EG = h/t). At that instant, according to Penrose OR, non-random,
‘non-computable Platonic values’ embedded in the fine scale structure of
spacetime geometry influence choices selected in the OR process. Whether
such Platonic values are themselves algorithmic and deterministic are
unknown. But to some extent at least, Orch OR dodges determinism.
A third issue with free will pertains to the timing of conscious action,
in that consciousness, in some cases, appears to come too late. Neural
correlates of conscious perception occur 150 to 500 milliseconds (msec)
after impingement on our sense organ, yet we often consciously respond
to those perceptions within 100 msec after sensory impingement. For
example (Velmans 1991) analysis of sensory inputs and emotional
content, phonological and semantic analysis of heard speech, preparation
of spoken words and sentences, forming memories, and performing
voluntary acts all occur, seemingly consciously, before the stimuli to
which the responses were aimed are processed. The conclusion among
neuroscientists and philosophers (Dennett & Kinsbourne 1992; Wegner
2002) has been that we act non-consciously, and have belated, false
impressions of conscious causal action. This implies that free will does
not exist, that consciousness is epiphenomenal, and that we are, as T.H.
Huxley bleakly summarized, “merely helpless spectators”.

167

LECTURES

Figure 11. The “readiness potential (RP)” (Libet et al. 1983). (A) Cortical potentials recorded
from a subject instructed to move his/her hand whenever he/she feels ready, and to note when the
decision was made (Conscious intent), followed quickly by the finger actually moving. (Time between
Conscious intent, and finger moving is fixed.) Readiness potential, RP, preceding Conscious intent is
generally interpreted as representing the Non-conscious choice to move the finger, with Conscious
intent being illusion. (B) Assuming RP is necessary preparation for conscious finger movement, Actual
conscious intent could initiate the earlier RP by (quantum) temporal non-locality and backward time
referral, enabling preparation while preserving real time conscious intent and control.

Some evidence appears to support the epiphenomenal contention.
Kornhuber and Deecke (1965) recorded electrical activity over pre-motor
cortex in subjects who were asked to move their finger randomly, at no
prescribed time. Gradually-increasing brain electrical activity preceded
finger movement by ∼800 msec, termed the readiness potential (‘RP’).
Benjamin Libet and colleagues (1983) repeated the RP experiment,
except they also asked subjects to note precisely when they consciously
decided to move their finger. (To do so, and to avoid delays caused by
verbal report, Libet et al. used a rapidly moving clock and asked subjects
to note when on the clock they consciously decided to move their finger).
The ‘conscious decision’ came ∼200ms before actual finger movement,
hundreds of milliseconds after onset of the RP. Kornhuber, Deeke, Libet
and others concluded the RP represented a non-conscious causal action of
the finger movement, that many seemingly conscious actions are initiated
non-consciously, and that conscious intent is an illusion. Consciousness
apparently comes too late.
But does it? Strangely, apparent backward time effects are observed in
brain biology related to consciousness, and theoretically allowable in quantum
physics. Could quantum backward time effects rescue conscious free will?

168

STUART HAMEROFF

In physics, the ‘arrow of time’ implies a flow of time in one
direction, toward increasing entropy according to the second law of
thermodynamics. However, other laws of physics are generally ‘time
reversible’, working quite well in both directions. In principle, there’s no
reason for an exclusively unidirectional arrow of time. In the WheelerDewitt equation, which attempts to mathematically reconcile quantum
mechanics and general relativity, time plays no role from an external
viewpoint. However in the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, conscious observers
within the universe do perceive a flow of time and events, the unidirectional
flow of time being exclusively related to consciousness (c.f. Hameroff,
2003). However consciousness may utilize backward time effects.
A principal hallmark of quantum physics is quantum entanglement
which implies complementary quantum particles (e.g. electrons in
coupled spin-up and spin-down pairs) remain entangled when separated
spatially (or temporally). Einstein initially objected, as it would require
signaling faster than light, and thus violate special relativity. He famously
termed it ‘spooky action at a distance’, and (with colleagues Podolsky
and Rosen – ‘EPR’) described a thought experiment in which an
entangled pair of superpositioned electrons (EPR pairs) would be sent
in different directions, each remaining in superposition (Einstein et al,
1935). When one electron was measured at its destination and, say, spinup was observed, its entangled twin miles away would, according to the
prediction, correspondingly reduce instantaneously to spin-down which
would be confirmed by measurement. The issue was unresolved at the
time of Einstein’s death, but since the early 1980s (Aspect et al. 1982,
Tittel et al. 1998) this type of experiment has been repeatedly confirmed
through wires, fiber optic cables and via microwave beams in the
atmosphere. Entanglement is an essential feature of quantum information
technologies such as quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation and
quantum computers. How does it occur?
Penrose (2004; cf. Bennett, and Wiesner 1992) proposed that
measurement and reduction of one twin of the EPR pair sends quantum
information backward in time to when the particles were spatially
together, then onward to the second twin. According to this scheme,
apparent backward time effects are necessary for entanglement, and thus
ubiquitous. Aharonov has proposed that quantum state reductions send

169

LECTURES

quantum information both forward and backward in time. In his 1989
book The emperor’s new mind, Penrose (1989) suggested quantum effects
could mediate the brain’s backward time referral of subjective information
reported by Benjamin Libet.
In the late 1970s and 1980s, Libet and colleagues (in addition to their
RP ‘move your finger’ research, described above) studied the timing of
conscious sensory experience in awake, cooperative patients undergoing
brain surgery with local anesthesia. This allowed stimulation and recording
of somatosensory cortex (e.g. of the hand), periphery (e.g. hand) and
direct report of the timing of conscious experience. (To avoid delays due
to reporting, subjects observed a fast moving clock, and noted precisely
when a sensory perception occurred.) Two types of sensory stimulation
were used, one type involving direct stimulation of the skin of the hand,
recording the sensory activity from somato-sensory ‘hand area’ of cortex,
and obtaining the subject’s report of the precise time of the conscious
experience (via the fast-moving clock). Generally, stimulation of the hand
resulted in (1) a cortical sensory-evoked potential (EP) at 30 msec after
stimulation, and (2) conscious sensory experience also occurring at 30
msec, 30 msec being roughly the time required for neural signals to reach
the brain from the hand. In these same subjects, Libet and colleagues also
directly stimulated the ‘hand area’ of somato-sensory cortex. They found
no EP, and discovered that 500 msec of continuously-induced cortical
activity was required for conscious sensation of the hand to occur at 500
msec. Libet concluded that 500 msec of cortical activity was required
to reach threshold for conscious ‘neuronal adequacy’. This requirement
for several hundreds of msec of direct cortical stimulation to produce
conscious experience (‘Libet’s half second’) was subsequently confirmed
by Amassian et al. (1991), Ray et al. (1999), Pollen (2004) and others.
It was also consistent with the subsequent work of Velmans (1991),
Dennett, Kinsbourne and others who maintained that consciousness
occurred several hundred msec after sensory impingement, and after
seemingly conscious responses. But then, how can conscious experience
occur at 30 msec with hand stimulation and the EP?

170

STUART HAMEROFF

Figure 12. Cortical potentials in Libet’s sensory experiments. (A) Peripheral stimulation, e.g.,
at the hand, results in near-immediate conscious experience of the stimulation, an evoked potential
EP at ∼30msec in the “hand area” of somatosensory cortex, and several 100 msec of ongoing cortical
electricalactivity. (B) Direct cortical activity of the somatosensory cortical hand area for several 100msec
results in no EP, ongoing cortical activity, and conscious sensory experience of the hand, but only after
∼500msec. Libet termed the 500msec of cortical activity resulting in conscious experience.

Figure 13. Libet’s sensory experiments, continued.(A) Libet et al. stimulated medial lemniscus of
thalamus in the sensory pathway to produce an EP (∼30ms) in somatosensory cortex, but only brief postEP stimulation, resulting in only brief cortical activity. There was no apparent “neuronal adequacy,” and
no conscious experience. An EP and several100 msec of post-EP cortical activity (neuronal adequacy)
were required for conscious experience at the time of EP. (B) To account for his findings, Libet concluded
that subjective information was referred backward in time from neuronal adequacy (∼500msec) to the EP.

To address this issue, Libet and colleagues did further studies in
human subjects stimulating medial lemniscus of thalamus, the primary
relay station between, e.g. hand and sensory cortex. Stimulating thalamus,
they observed a cortical EP at 30 msec, and ongoing cortical activity
for as long as they stimulated thalamus. If the stimulation and ongoing

171

LECTURES

cortical activity persisted for ∼500 msec, the subjects reported conscious
experience at 30 msec, the time of the EP. If, however, stimulation and
cortical activity were stopped after the EP, but prior to ∼500 msec, no
conscious experience occurred. Somehow, the brain ‘knew’ whether or
not cortical activity would continue for hundreds of msec after the EP
for consciousness to occur at the time of the EP. Libet concluded that
subjective information was referred ‘backward in time’ from neuronal
adequacy at ∼500 msec to the time of the EP at 30 msec. Libet’s backward
time assertion was disbelieved and ridiculed (e.g. Churchland, 1981;
Dennett & Kinsbourne 1992) but never refuted. Indeed, several types of
experiments have continued to show backward time effects in the brain.
Electrodermal activity measures skin impedance, usually with a
probe wrapped around a finger, as an index of autonomic, sympathetic
neuronal activity causing changes in blood flow and sweating, in turn
triggered by emotional response in the brain. Researchers Dean Radin
and Dick Bierman have published a series of well-controlled studies using
electrodermal activity to look for emotional responses to images presented
at random times on a computer screen. They found that emotional
images elicited responses half a second to two seconds before the images
appeared. They termed the effect pre-sentiment because the subjects were
not consciously aware of the emotional feelings; non-conscious emotional
sentiment (i.e. feelings) appeared to be referred backward in time.
In 2011, Daryl Bem published “Feeling the future: Experimental
evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect”
in the mainstream Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. The article
reported on 8 studies showing statistically significant backward time
effects, most involving non-conscious influence of future emotional effects
(e.g. erotic or threatening stimuli) on cognitive choices. Mossbridge et al.
(2012) published a meta-analysis of 26 reports published between 1978
and 2010 showing backward time effects, and concluded the results were
valid. Moreover they pointed to findings in mainstream neuroscience
which show backward time effects but are not reported.
In the famous double slit experiment in quantum physics, quantum
entities (e.g. photons, electrons) can behave as either waves, or particles,
depending on the method chosen to measure them. John Wheeler
described a thought experiment in which the measurement choice

172

STUART HAMEROFF

(by a conscious human observer) was delayed until after the electron
or other quantum entity passed though the slits, presumably as either
wave or particle. Wheeler suggested the observer’s delayed choice could
retroactively influence the behavior of the electrons, e.g. as waves or
particles. The experiment was eventually performed and confirmed
Wheeler’s prediction; conscious choices can affect previous events, as
long as the events were not consciously observed in the interim.
In ‘delayed choice entanglement swapping’, originally a thought
experiment proposed by Asher Peres (2000), Ma et al. (2012) went a
step further. In entanglement swapping, two pairs of unified/entangled
particles are separated, and one from each pair is sent to two measurement
devices, each associated with a conscious observer (‘Alice’ and ‘Bob’, as
is the convention in such quantum experiments). The other entangled
particle from each pair is sent to a third observer, Victor. How Victor
decides to measure the two particles (as an entangled pair, or as separable
particles) determines whether Alice and Bob observe them as entangled
(showing quantum correlations) or separable (showing classical
correlations). This happens even if Victor decides after Alice’s and Bob’s
devices have measured them (but before Alice and Bob consciously view
the results). Thus Victor’s conscious choice affects behavior of previously
measured, but unobserved, events. Entanglement apparently includes not
only spooky action at a distance, but spooky action on past events. Anton
Zeilinger, senior author on the Ma et al. study, said: “Within a naïve
classical worldview, quantum mechanics can even mimic an influence of
future actions on past events”.
Such influences in the brain can allow real-time conscious control of
our actions, seen as deviation from Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal behavior
(Figure 14). With quantum brain biology, consciousness does not come
too late. Free will is possible.

Figure 14. As in Figure 4, Integrate-and-fire neuronal behaviors. a. The Hodgkin-Huxley model
predicts integration, narrow threshold potential and low temporal variability in firing at the proximal
axon (AIS) b. Recordings from cortical neurons in awake animals (Naundorf et al. 2006) show a large
variability in effective firing threshold and timing. Some additional factor, perhaps related to consciousness
(‘C’) exerts causal influence on firing and behavior, and may include backward time referral.

6. Tuning the brain
Orch OR has been skeptically viewed on the basis of ‘decoherence’ (i.e.
random, ‘un-orchestrated’ OR). Technological quantum computers require
extreme cold, near absolute zero temperature, to avoid thermal vibrations
which appear to disrupt delicate quantum effects. Critics said the brain is
simply too ‘warm, wet and noisy’ for functional quantum effects.
Orch OR countered theoretically that coherence akin to Bose-Einstein
condensation, and described for biological systems by Herbert Fröhlich,
converted thermal energy to coherent vibrations, somewhat like a laser.
Quantum spin transfer through aromatic rings was shown to be promoted
by heat, not disrupted (Ouyang & Awschalom, 2003), and beginning in
2006, evidence began to accrue for warm temperature quantum coherence
in photosynthesis proteins (Engel et al, 2007). Recently, room temperature
Bose-Einstein condensation has been demonstrated (Plumhof et al 2014).
The brain is not too ‘warm’ for functional quantum effects.
Orch OR also suggested microtubule quantum coherence originated
in isolated, non-polar, ‘hydrophobic’ regions within tubulin (‘quantum
channels’), shielded from polar, aqueous interactions. At such quantum
sites, anesthetic molecules selectively erase consciousness, acting
by quantum London forces. The brain is not too ‘wet’ for functional
quantum effects, at least not in ‘dry’ quantum channels.

174

STUART HAMEROFF

Is the brain too ‘noisy’? Seemingly random electrical fluctuations
occur continuously throughout the brain, embedded as background in
the EEG. The fluctuations emanate mostly from neuronal post-synaptic
membrane potentials which don’t reach threshold for axonal firing.
According to standard neuroscience doctrine, such activity is irrelevant,
as firings are all that matter, and dendritic-somatic ‘noise’ (though it
constitutes ‘integration’) is ignored as irrelevant. Is it really?
The ‘noise’ is seen at all levels—neuronal, network, and the entire
brain. While appearing locally random, brain electrical noise, or ‘ongoing
activity’, is highly synchronized, or correlated (Arieli et al, 1996). The
fluctuations are precisely the same everywhere. In pyramidal neurons,
simultaneous recording of ‘noise’ in soma and apical dendrite (micron
separation) show ‘isopotentiality’, near-perfect correlation (YaronJakoubovitch et al 2008). Could correlated ‘noise’ have a function? Perhaps
dendritic-somatic ‘noise’ is essential, or at least related to, cognition and
consciousness (Pockett, 2000; McFadden, 2002). Perhaps brain noise is,
as it has been said, “the brain orchestra warming up”. Orch OR suggests
correlated brain ‘noise’ originates from deeper level, finer scale quantum
vibrations in microtubules inside neurons.

Figure 15. Five frequency bands of microtubule and brain activity plotted on a log scale. Starting
at right, E and D are gigahertz and megahertz resonance frequencies found in individual microtubules
(Sahu et al. 2013a, 2013b). B, C and D are kilohertz, tens of kilohertz and megahertz resonance
frequencies detected from microtubule bundles inside active neurons (Bandyopadhyay 2014). A is the
EEG spectrum put in ‘by hand’. The 5 bands are self—similar and separated evenly by ~3 orders of
magnitude, suggesting a harmonic system. EEG (A) may be derived as inverse harmonics, or ‘beats’ of
higher frequency microtubule vibrations.

175

LECTURES

Brain noise (and measurable EEG) derive from local field potentials
due to post-synaptic trans-membrane potentials of roughly 100 millivolt
fluctuations, mediated by ion fluxes through membrane protein
channels. (Axonal firing potentials, or ‘spikes’, contribute only in a
small way to noise and EEG.) Bandyopadhyay’s megahertz and kilohertz
electric field fluctuations from microtubule bundles inside neurons of
40 to 50 millivolts are sufficient to influence and regulate membrane
potentials. Hameroff and Penrose (2014) suggested interference between
microtubules vibrating at slightly different megahertz, or kilohertz,
frequencies would give rise to slower ‘beat’ frequencies, seen as membrane
potential fluctuations in EEG or brain noise. EEG is the tip of an iceberg
of brain activity.
Thus brain activity relevant to cognition and consciousness may occur at
various spatiotemporal scales, moving and combining, like music. Sequences
of events at different frequencies, in some cases harmonically related, appear
to be anchored by resonances inherent in microtubule lattice geometry.
By Penrose OR, Orch OR events are also ripples, or rearrangements in
fundamental spacetime geometry. Orch OR connects conscious brain
activities to processes in the fine scale structure of the universe.
Within the brain, neuronal and microtubule vibrations span 10
orders of magnitude (Figure 15), and may be directly relevant to mental
states. Microtubule vibrations inside brain neurons offer therapeutic
opportunities for mood, cognition and neurological disorders.
Modern psychopharmacology aimed at modulating mental states,
mood and cognitive function, based on the standard computationalist
approach in neuroscience, has as its targets neuronal membrane receptor
and channel proteins, and thus may be somewhat misguided. For example
the antidepressant Prozac aims to prolong action of the neurotransmitter
serotonin at its synaptic receptors (by inhibiting its ‘reuptake’). The
membrane-mediated effect is immediate, but mood improves only after
several weeks, apparently allowing dendritic-somatic microtubules to
reorganize (Bianchi et al, 2009).
Anti-anxiety benzodiazepine drugs such as Valium, Versed and Xanax
are said to act by enhancing binding of GABA (gamma-amino-butyric
acid), the brain’s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, to its membrane
‘GABA receptor’ proteins. But benzodiazepine molecules have several

176

STUART HAMEROFF

non-polar rings, directly inhibit microtubules in mitosis (Troutt et al.
1995), and are likely to enter neurons and bind in microtubule quantum
channels. Similarly, opiate drugs which cause euphoria bind to opiate
receptors, but also enter neurons and likely bind in microtubules. While
receptor binding occurs, mood-altering drugs may act to tune microtubule
vibrations and mellow the music.
Psychedelic drugs are also highly non-polar, contain indole electron
resonance rings, and able to enter neurons. Potency of such molecules
correlates with their ability to donate electron resonance energy (Kang,
and Green; Snyder, and Merrill), thus perhaps promoting microtubule
quantum vibrations at higher frequencies, and vibrational resonances
over many scales.
Anesthetics have opposite effects, selectively erasing consciousness
while sparing non-conscious brain functions. They include numerous gas
molecules whose potency correlates precisely with solubility in a nonpolar, ‘olive oil’ medium, e.g. as found in lipids, and protein hydrophobic
interiors. Franks and Lieb (1984) showed that anesthetics act in non-polar,
hydrophobic regions of proteins (not in lipids), presumably membrane
proteins, with receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine and GABA
the most likely candidates. But despite decades of widespread searching,
particular membrane receptors or channels mediating anesthetic action
have not been found.
In 2006, Rod Eckenhoff’s lab at University of Pennsylvania showed
that anesthetics such as halothane bind to ∼70 proteins in brain neurons,
roughly half membrane proteins, and half cytoskeletal proteins including
tubulin. Following anesthetic exposure, genetic expression of tubulin,
but not of any membrane proteins, was altered. Genomic and proteomic
evidence point to microtubules as the site of anesthetic action. Emerson
et al. (86) used fluorescent anthracene as an anesthetic in tadpoles, and
showed cessation of tadpole behavior occurs specifically via anthracene
anesthetic binding in tadpole brain microtubules. Despite prevailing
assumptions, actual evidence suggests anesthetics act on microtubules,
not membrane receptors and channels to erase consciousness.
Thus modern psychopharmacology may be aiming at the wrong
targets, thus explaining why it isn’t more successful in treating mental
state disorders. A primary reason membrane receptors and channels

177

LECTURES

are studied is that their effects (drug binding, conformational change,
channel opening) are measurable. Until recently, there was no assay for
microtubule function other than polymerization states of assembly/
disassembly. Now however resonance vibrations, e.g. in megahertz, have
been discovered, and drugs may be assayed for their effects on microtubule
resonance spectra inside neurons. New vistas await in the study of drug
effects on microtubule vibrations.
Another avenue to treating mental states and cognitive dysfunction
comes through noninvasive brain stimulation techniques. Among these are
transcranial magnetic stimulation (‘TMS’), transcranial electrical direct
current stimulation (‘TDcS’) and transcranial ultrasound stimulation
(‘TUS’), all of which have shown promise and interesting effects. Among
these, only TUS can be narrowly focused to target specific, deeper brain
regions (Legon et al. 2014).
Ultrasound consists of mechanical vibrations above human hearing
threshold (∼20,000 Hz), and is usually used in the low megahertz (106
to 107 Hz) for medical imaging, passing through the body and echoing
back off surfaces. TUS consists of low intensity, sub-thermal levels of
ultrasound administered at the scalp which safely penetrates skull and
reaches the brain sufficiently to be echoed back to provide an image of
the brain surface and sulci. As microtubules have megahertz vibrational
resonances, TUS with proper settings might be expected to enhance
microtubule resonance, and thereby affect microtubule functions related
to cognition and mental states. Indeed, focused TUS enhances sensory
discrimination in human volunteers (Legon et al, 2014), and unfocused
TUS improved mood in chronic pain patients (Hameroff et al. 2013).
At the cellular level in embryonic neurons, ultrasound promotes
growth of neurites leading to formation of axons, dendrites and synapses
(Raman). At the level of tubulin, ultrasound promotes microtubule
assembly. As traumatic brain injury involves disrupted microtubules,
synapses and circuits, and as Alzheimer’s disease and post-operative
cognitive dysfunction (cognitive decline after anesthesia in elderly), TUS
may be useful for all these disorders.
Traumatic memory is an important factor in psychotherapy (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder). Some suggest eliciting a traumatic memory
and then over-writing it at that time with a positive memory (Lane et

178

al). Since synaptic membrane proteins are too short-lived to store and
encode memory, and microtubules appear likely to do so, psychotherapy
combined with TUS aimed at microtubule vibrations may be optimal.
To erase or over-write traumatic memory, to change the music and
re-tune the tubules, combinations of pharmacology, psychotherapy and
TUS (e.g. aimed at microtubule vibrations in amygdala, hippocampus
and pre-frontal cortex) may be optimal. As the Beatles sang, “Take a sad
song and make it better”.
7. Conclusion
The mainstream materialist approach to brain function in neuroscience
and philosophy suggests that consciousness and cognition emerge as
higher order network effects from complex computation among relatively
simple neurons. The fine grain of conscious and cognitive information is
conveyed at the neuronal level by axonal firings and synaptic transmissions
mediated entirely by membrane proteins.
This approach has failed. Neuronal computational networks fail to
account for (1) cognitive phenomenal aspects of single cell organisms
like paramecium which swim, learn, find food and mates and have sex, all
without synaptic connections, using their cytoskeletal microtubules for
sensory processing and motor actions, (2) phenomenal subjective aspects
of consciousness (the ‘hard problem’), (3) free will as real-time conscious
control, neuronal activity correlating with perception occurring after
seemingly conscious response, relegating consciousness to epiphenomenal
‘helpless spectator’, (4) memory, as membrane proteins determining
synaptic sensitivity are transient, and yet memories can last lifetimes,
(5) molecular mechanisms for drugs affecting consciousness including
anesthetics, which selectively erase consciousness, but despite popular
belief, do not act on membranes, and (6) scientific plausibility for nonlocality, e.g. so-called telepathy, pre-cognition, near death/out-of-body
experiences, and afterlife. These are generally stated to be impossible
because they cannot be scientifically explained by the mainstream view
based on neuronal-based computation. But the mainstream materialist
view can’t really explain anything about consciousness. And materialism
itself is illusory, as particles repeatedly coalesce from quantum possibilities.

In spiritual and idealist approaches, consciousness has in some sense
always existed in the universe, being in some way intrinsic to its very
makeup. Some such views place consciousness as primary, omnipresent,
with matter and the world manifesting within an all-pervading
consciousness. But such approaches themselves are as yet untestable and
unfalsifiable, essentially putting consciousness outside science.
Orch OR is based on deeper level quantum vibrations in microtubules
inside neurons, quantum vibrations which occur in the fine scale
structure of spacetime geometry. Orch OR provides a bridge between the
two approaches, and an opportunity to treat mental disorders by tuning
microtubule quantum vibrations
