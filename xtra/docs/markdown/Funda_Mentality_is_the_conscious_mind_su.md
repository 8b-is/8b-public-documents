"Funda-Mentality" Is the Conscious Mind Subtly Linked to a Basic Level of the
Universe?
Summary
Stuart Hameroff

Age-old battle lines over the puzzling nature of mental experience are shaping a modern
resurgence in the study of consciousness. On one side are the long-dominant "physicalists"
(reductionists, materialists, functionalists, computationalists. . ) who see consciousness as an
emergent property of the brain's neural networks ("brain = mind = computer"). On the
alternative, rebellious side are those who see a necessary added ingredient: proto-conscious
experience intrinsic to reality, perhaps understandable through modern physics (panpsychists,
pan-experientialists, "funda-mentalists"). It is argued here that the physicalist premise alone is
unable to solve completely the difficult issues of consciousness (e.g. experience, binding, preconscious conscious transition, non-computability and free will) and that to do so will require
supplemental panpsychist/pan-experiential philosophy expressed in modern physics. In one such
scheme proto-conscious experience is a basic property of physical reality accessible to a
quantum process associated with brain activity. The proposed process is Roger Penrose's
objective reduction (OR), a self-organizing "collapse" of the quantum wave function related to
instability at the most basic level of spacetime geometry. In the Penrose-Hameroff model of
"orchestrated objective reduction" ("Orch OR"), OR quantum computation occurs in cytoskeletal
microtubules within the brain's neurons and links cognition with proto-conscious experience and
Platonic values embedded in spacetime geometry. The basic idea is that consciousness involves
brain activities coupled to self-organizing ripples in fundamental reality.
Introduction - A Burning Issue

Can conscious experience-feelings, qualia, our "inner life"-be accommodated within present-day
science? Those who believe it can (e.g. physicalists, reductionists, materialists, functionalists,
computationalists) see conscious experience as an emergent property of complex neural network
computation. Others see conscious experience either outside science (dualists), or believe science
must expand to include experience (idealists, panpsychists, pan-experientialists, "fundamentalists"). These philosophical battle lines were originally drawn in ancient Greece between
Socrates, who believed the cerebrum created consciousness, and Aristotle, Democritus, Thales
and others who argued that mental qualities belonged to fundamental reality. Perhaps both sides
were correct.
Brain = Mind = Computer?

The basic physicalist idea is that the mind is a computer functioning in the brain's neural
networks. The current leading candidate for a computer-like "neural correlate" of consciousness
involves synchronously oscillating feedback loops of thalamo-cortical neurons. Higher
frequencies (collectively known as "coherent 40 Hz") have been suggested to mediate temporal
binding of conscious experience (e.g. Singer, Gray, Crick and Koch, etc.). The proposals vary,
for example as to whether coherence originates in thalamus or resonates in cortical networks, but
"thalamo-cortical 40 Hz" stands as a prevalent view of the substrate for consciousness.

But how do synchronized neural firings and synaptic transmissions produce experiential qualia,
emotions or free will? Physicalists believe this to be relatively straightforward (brain = mind =
computer) however others find the question intractable, or as vexing as trying to coax a reluctant
genie from a magic lamp. I see three problems with the brain = mind = computer analogy:
1. Is consciousness classical computation? In a controversial stance Roger Penrose 1-3 has
asserted that essential aspects of consciousness are non-computable. But regardless,
classical computers appear to be evolving toward quantum computers. Beginning in the
early 1980's Benioff, Feynman and others proposed that states in a system - bits in a
computer - could interact while in quantum superposition of all possible states, effecting
near-infinite parallel computation. Rather than classical Boolean bit states 1 or 0,
quantum computers would utilize interactive "qubits" of 1 and 0. If quantum computers
can ever be constructed they will have huge advantages in important applications. As the
brain/mind has always been cast as current information technology, consciousness may
inevitably be seen as some form of quantum computation.
2. Are neural firings the "fine grain" of consciousness? Cells and synapses are far more
complex than simple onoff switches. Consider the paramecium, a single cell organism
which gracefully swims, avoids predators, learns to escape from capillary tubes, and finds
food and mates. Observing intelligent behavior in unicellular creatures C.S. Sherrington
said in 1951: "Of nerve there is no trace. But the cell framework, the cyto-skeleton, might
serve." Lacking synapses, paramecium utilizes its cytoskeleton for communication and
organization. Neurons have a rich and dynamic set of cytoskeletal microtubules which
regulates synapses, and tremendously increases potential computational capacity (e.g.
1016 bit states/second/neuron)4. More importantly, neurons are alive and we don't yet
know what that implies for consciousness.
3. Details which don't fit the brain = mind = computer scheme are overlooked.
For example:
a. Neurotransmitter vesicle release and cognitive reaction times are "noisy", and
exhibit apparent probabilistic randomness (?noncomputable quantum
indeterminacy5).
b. Axonal firing patterns (rather than average frequency) and dendriticdendritic
processing may be relevant to consciousness6.
c. Apart from chemical synapses, primitive electrotonic gap junctions couple
neurons and glia synchronously and may play an important role in consciousness.
d. Glial cells (80% of the brain) are ignored in the brainascomputer view.
Quibbling aside, the physicalist view fails to address difficult issues. For example the problem of
'binding' in vision and self is often attributed to temporal correlation (e.g. coherent 40 Hz), but it
is unclear why temporal correlation per se should bind experience without an explanation of
experience. Regarding transition from preconscious or implicit processing to consciousness
itself, the physicalist view sees emergence at a critical level of neural-level computational
complexity. But no conscious threshold is apparent, nor is there a reasonable suggestion why
such an emergent property should have conscious experience. As physicalism is based on
deterministic computation, it is also unable to account for free will or Penrose's proposed non-

computability. But the major problem remains experience, for which physicalism offers no
testable predictions. Something is missing.
Panpsychism Meets Modern Physics

Perhaps panpsychists are in some way correct and components of mental processes are
fundamental, like mass, spin or charge. Following the ancient Greek panpsychists, Spinoza
(1677) saw some form of consciousness in all matter. Leibniz (1766) portrayed the universe as
an infinite number of fundamental units ("monads") each having a primitive psychological being.
Whitehead (e.g. 1929) was a process philosopher who viewed reality as a collection of events
occurring in a basic field of protoconscious experience ("occasions of experience"). Abner
Shimony7 observed that Whitehead's occasions were comparable to quantum state reductionsactual events in physical reality (see below). But what of Whitehead's "basic field" of protoconscious experience? How could experience (qualia) simply exist in empty space?
What is empty space? This question also stems from ancient Greece. Democritus argued that
empty space was a true void whereas Aristotle contended that it was in fact a plenum
(background filled with substance)-a medium in which heat and light traveled. Siding with
Aristotle, Maxwell's 19th century theory of the luminiferous ether described a plenum that carried
electromagnetic waves. However attempts to detect the ether failed and Einstein's special
relativity in 1905 reverted to Democritus in that empty space was an absolute void. However ten
years later Einstein's general relativity with its curved space and distorted geometry reversed his
stand to opt for a richly-endowed plenum termed the spacetime metric.

Figure 1. Two descriptions of fundamental spacetime geometry. a) A quantum spin network. Introduced by Roger
Penrose8 as a quantum mechanical description of the geometry of space, spin networks describe a spectra of
discrete Planck scale volumes and configurations9,10. Average length of each link is the Planck length (1033 cm). b)
Four dimensional spacetime may be schematically represented by one dimension of space and one dimension of
time: a two dimensional "spacetime sheet." Mass is curvature in spacetime, and the two spacetime curvatures in the
top of Figure 1b represent mass (e.g. a tubulin protein) in two different locations, or conformations respectively. In
quantum superposition mass separated from itself is simultaneous spacetime curvature in opposite directions, a
separation or "bubble" of spacetime. At a critical degree of separation, the system becomes unstable and must select
either one state or the other2.

We now know that at very small scales space and time are not smooth, but quantized. This
granularity occurs at the incredibly small dimensions of the "Planck scale" at 10-33 centimeters
and 10-43 seconds. Roger Penrose portrays this basic makeup of the universe as a dynamical
spider-web of quantum spins8. These "spin networks" create an evolving array of Planck scale
geometric volumes defining four dimensional spacetime (Figure 1a). Penrose applies Einstein's
general relativity (in which mass equates to curvature, or perturbation of spacetime) all the way
down to this near-infinitesimal geometry (Figure 1b). Thus everything is in reality particular
arrangements of spacetime geometry. Building on these ideas, Lee Smolin9,10 likens spin network
volumes to Leibniz monads and suggests that self-organizing processes at this level constitute a
flow of time, raising the issue of whether the universe is in some sense alive. Could
infinitesimally small, weak and fast processes be coupled to biology? A reasonable possibility

for such a link is Penrose's objective reduction-a particular type of quantum state reduction in
which new macroscopic information emerges.
At the Edge of Reality: Quantum State Reduction and Consciousness

Quantum theory describes the bizarre wave/particle duality of energy and matter at very small
scales. The behavior is so strange that the American physicist Richard Feynman once
commented "anyone who claims to understand quantum theory is either lying or crazy."
Strange as it is, quantum theory offers features which may be relevant to consciousness. One is
that large collections of quantum particle/waves can merge into unitary coherent states of
macroscopic size and influence. Superconductors, BoseEinstein condensates and lasers are
unitary states in which component atoms or molecules give up individual identity and behavior.
Such coherent quantum states have been suggested to occur among brain proteins to provide
unitary "binding" in vision and sense of self11,12.
Another feature involves "quantum superposition." Components of isolated small scale systems
can exist in different states or locations simultaneously. This is contrary to our perceived
macroscopic world in which objects have well defined positions and are decidedly concrete. The
problem is the transition-why and how do microscopic quantum superposed states become
classical and definite in the macro-world? This problem is called quantum state reduction, or
collapse of the wave function, and it may be the key to both consciousness and reality.
Experimental evidence in the early part of this century led great theorists Bohr, Heisenberg and
Wigner to conclude (the "Copenhagen interpretation") that objects remain in wave-like quantum
superposition until observed by a conscious human being-consciousness causes collapse of the
wave function! To illustrate the apparent absurdity of this conclusion, in the 1930's Schrodinger
devised his famous thought experiment Schrodinger's cat. A living cat is placed in a box into
which poison can be released by a quantum event, e.g., sending a photon through a half-silvered
mirror. So after the photon has been sent there are equal possibilities that the cat is either dead or
alive. But according to the Copenhagen interpretation until a conscious being opens the box to
observe, the cat is both dead and alive. Schrodinger's point was that the conscious observer
interpretation was incorrect.
Many physicists now believe that intermediate between tiny quantum-scale systems and "large"
cat-size systems some objective factor disturbs the superposition to cause collapse, or "objective
reduction (OR)." According to Roger Penrose2,13 this objective factor is an intrinsic feature of
spacetime itself (quantum gravity). As mass is equivalent to spacetime curvature, Penrose begins
with the notion that quantum superpositionactual separation (displacement) of mass from itself is
equivalent to simultaneous spacetime curvatures in opposite directions, causing "bubbles," or
separations in fundamental reality (Figure 1b). Penrose reasons that these bubble-like separations
are unstable and reduce to specific states and locations after a critical degree of separation. If
proto-conscious experience is rooted in the Planck scale, then objective reductions (Whitehead's
occasions of experience) may ripple through an experiential medium.
Could OR events occur in the brain? The critical spacetime separation precipitating Penrose's OR
is given by the uncertainty principle E=h/T. E is the energy of the superposed mass, h is Planck's

constant over 2pi, and T is the coherence time until reduction. The size (and energy) of a
superposed system (degree of spacetime separation) is inversely related to the time T until selfcollapse. If isolated, a large system (e.g. Schrodinger's one kilogram cat) will undergo OR very
quickly, e.g. in only 10-37 seconds. A small system such as a single isolated superposed atom
would undergo OR only after 107 years. OR brain events would be linked to neural processes
with T in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (e.g. 25 msec intervals in coherent 40
Hz). For T=25 msec (40 Hz) OR events, E corresponds to roughly 3 nanograms (3 x 10-9 gram)
of superposed brain mass.
Nanograms of what? Which biological structures could function as both classical and quantum
computers, avoid environmental decoherence and couple to neural-level activities? Microtubules
are the logical candidates.
Are Microtubules Quantum Computers? The PenroseHameroff "Orch OR" Model

Interiors of neurons and glia are functionally organized by webs of protein polymersthe
cytoskeleton14. Its major components are microtubules, actin and intermediate filaments.
Microtubules are selfassembling hollow cylinders whose walls are crystalline lattices of subunit
proteins known as tubulin. Evidence links the neuronal cytoskeleton to cognitive functions, and
theoretical models suggest interactive microtubule subunits function as molecular automata
capable of nanosecond-scale computation (Figure 2a)4.

Figure 2. Schematic of neural synapse showing cytoskeletal structures within two neurons. Left: Pre-synaptic axon
terminals releases neurotransmitter vesicles (black spheres) into synaptic cleft. Thick, black rod-like structures at
top indicate microtubules; thinner filaments (e.g. synapsin) facilitate vesicle release. Right: Dendrite on postsynaptic neuron with two dendritic spines. Microtubules in main dendrite are interconnected by microtubuleassociated proteins. Other cytoskeletal structures (fodrin, actin filaments, etc.) connect membrane receptors to
microtubules. Based on Hirokawa14.

Roger Penrose and I have developed a model in which quantum superposition, objective
reduction and quantum computation occur in microtubule automata within brain neurons and
glia. Microtubuleassociatedproteins (MAPs) provide feedback and "tune" the quantum
oscillations; the proposed OR is thus selforganized ("orchestrated" objective reduction"Orch
OR")15-21. In the Orch OR model microtubule quantum computation is isolated from decoherence
(Box 1) and continues until threshold is met (E=h/T) and an OR event occurs (Figure 2b). For
example an OR event coinciding with one 40 Hz cycle (T = 25 msec) would require E = 2 x 1010
superposed tubulins (roughly 20,000 neurons).
Quantum computation in the Orch OR scheme differs from technological proposals in that
superpositions in the latter will reduce to output states by environmental
decoherencecomputation is terminated by intervention and choice of states has an element of
randomness. On the other hand, in the Orch OR scheme isolated superpositions self-reduce due

to instability in spacetime separation. The choice of outcome states, according to Penrose, is
therefore neither completely deterministic nor random, but has an element of noncomputabilityinfluenced by Platonic logic embedded in spacetime. Penrose has also suggested
that aspects of human understanding and consciousness involve non-computability, a
controversial and widely assailed claim. Although outnumbered by his critics, Penrose has
thoroughly and systematically answered them3. Non-computability is a clue, a delicate thread
with which to unravel the mystery of consciousness.
Orch OR and Cognition

Each proposed Orch OR event consists of 1) an isolated quantum computing phase identified
with preconscious, implicit processing which culminates in 2) instantaneous reduction
corresponding with a discrete conscious "now" event-a Whitehead "occasion of experience."
Each event selects (noncomputably) particular configurations of Planck-scale experiential
geometry and corresponding classical states of microtubule automata which regulate
synaptic/neural functions (Figure 2; Figure 3a,b). Sequences of discrete conscious events (e.g. at
40 Hz) can provide a "stream" of consciousness.

Figure 3. Orch OR events in conscious experience. a) (left) Three tubulins in quantum superposition prior to 25
msec Orch OR After reduction (right), particular classical states are selected. b) Fundamental spacetime geometry
view. Prior to Orch OR (left), spacetime corresponding with three superposed tubulins is separated as Planck scale
bubbles: curvatures in opposite directions. The Planckscale spacetime separations S are very tiny in ordinary terms,
but relatively large mass movements (e.g., hundreds of tubulin conformations, each moving from 106 to 0.2 nm)
indeed have precisely such very tiny effects on the spacetime curvature. A critical degree of separation causes Orch
OR and an abrupt selection of single curvatures (and a particular geometry of experience). c) Cognitive facial
recognition. A familiar face induces superposition (left) of three possible solutions (Amy, Betty, Carol) which
"collapse" to the correct answer Carol (right). d) Cognitive volition. Three possible dinner selections (shrimp, sushi,
pasta) are considered in superposition (left), and collapse via Orch OR to choice of sushi (right).

Consider Orch OR in the context of two cognitive tasks: facial recognition and ordering dinner
(Figure 3c,d). Each may occur in a series of steps yielding intermediate solutions, however for
the purpose of illustration consider how single Orch OR conscious events could accomplish
these tasks. (Although classical neurallevel parallel computation can partially explain these
functions, the Orch OR scheme provides far greater information capacity, conscious experience,
binding, and noncomputability consistent with free will.)
Imagine you briefly see a familiar woman's face (Figure 3c). Is she Amy, Betty, or Carol? All
possibilities may superpose in quantum computation. For example during 25 milliseconds of preconscious processing quantum computation occurs with information (Amy, Betty, Carol) in the
form of "qubits", superposed states of microtubule automata. As threshold for objective
reduction is reached, superposed tubulin qubits reduce (collapse) to definite states, becoming
bits. Now, you recognize Carol as a particular experiential geometry is selected! (Many more
than three possibilities, in fact an astronomically high number of possibilities could be
superposed in microtubule quantum computing.)
In a volitional act possible choices may be superposed. Suppose you are selecting dinner from a
menu. During preconscious processing, shrimp, sushi and pasta are superposed. As threshold for
objective reduction is reached, the quantum state reduces to a single classical state whose
selection results from deterministic quantum computation influenced at the moment of reduction
by Platonic logic embedded in the Planck scale. A choice is made. You'll have sushi!
Conclusion

The Orch OR model is consistent with known neurophysiological processes, generates numerous
testable predictions18,19 and is the type of multi-level, trans-disciplinary theory required to
address the mind's enigmatic features. Consciousness may involve subtle links between the brain
and fundamental spacetime geometry.

Isolated Macroscopic Quantum States in the Brain?
At first glance the brain is a noisy, thermal environment, hardly hospitable to delicate quantum
effects which require (in the technological realm) extreme cold to prevent thermal excitations
and environmental decoherence. However nature may have solved the problem of quantum state
isolation. For example Dan Sacketta of NIH has recently shown that microtubules may be
insulated from thermal noise by a surrounding sleeve of plasma-like charge condensation.
But how could isolated cytoplasmic quantum states traverse membranes and synapses to occur
macroscopically among microtubules in (e.g. 20,000) neurons throughout the brain? One
possibility involves quantum tunneling through gap junctions, primitive electrotonic windows
between neurons and glia. Neurons interconnected by gap junctions form networks which fire
synchronously, "behaving like one giant neuron"f (possibly accounting for synchronized 40 Hz
neural activityg). Unlike chemical synapses which separate neural processes by 3050 nanometers,
gap junction separations are 3.5 nanometers, within range for quantum tunneling. Gap junctions
are widespread but unevenly distributed. Immunolabeling of gap junction protein (connexin)
precursor demonstrates high levels in thalamic subnuclei, layers 2 and 3 of cortex, and
midbrainh. Thalamocortical networks of gap junctionconnected neurons with sol-gel phases
coupled to synchronized 40 Hz activity could isolate microtubules across large brain volumes
and provide cycles of isolated macroscopic quantum coherence.
