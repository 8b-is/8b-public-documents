Is Consciousness a New Form of Energy?
Syed Ismyl Mahmood Rizvi
ABSTRACT: This paper is aiming to investigate the physical substrates of conscious
process. It will argue: How does the conscious process establish relations between their
external stimuli and internal stimuli in order to create reality? Within this framework, the
paper will also attempt to locate the origins of consciousness in the brain.
Keywords: consciousness, conscious energy, thought mechanism, neural signal, brain waves

INTRODUCTION
How far down may we go in search of the capacity of consciousness in the hierarchy of
nervous systems – vertebrates, invertebrates, single-celled organisms? (Chakravarthy, 2014)
Neurons are not essential for the basic life process (Damasio, 2010), as Protozoans like
Paramecium can swim, find food and mates, learn, remember (Nakagaki et al., 2000;
Adamatzky, 2012) and have conjunction, all without synaptic computation.
When we become conscious in the morning, the brain is globally activated, every part
showing faster and more widely connected neural traffic. It is as if suddenly all the neurons
jumped into their cars and decided to go places. As a novel or surprising event catches our
attention, a vast electrical tidal wave rushes all over the brain, a few tenths of a second after
the triggering event. This is called the ‘event-related potential.’ Limited functions are closely
associated with conscious experience, while very large capacity functions are generally
unconscious (Baars, 2010). Some scientists have argued that capacity limits are due to the
role of consciousness in combining numerous components of a very large brain into an
integrated whole (Baars, 1988, 2002b; Edelman, 1989; Llinas & Pare, 1991). Consciousness
arises as a particular kind of brain process that is both highly unified (or integrated) and
highly complex (or differentiated) — has wide-ranging implications (Edelman, 2000).

The basic question seems simple: is the world basically mental or physical? Or, in today’s
language, can your conscious experience be explained by neurons? (Edelman, 1989; Palmer,
1999; Koch, 1996; Tulving, 2002; Baars et al., 2003a). However, in this paper I will argue
that there are elementary substrates of consciousness.
EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCES
First described in ‘The Lancet’ in 2007 (Feuillet, 2007), the case of the 44 years old
Frenchman may put us forth to question the theories stating the existence of consciousness in
various specific regions of the brain. The man suffering from a specific type of
hydrocephalus known as ‘chronic non-communicating hydrocephalus’ lived most of his life
without being mentally disturbed. In this context, Axel Cleeremans, a cognitive psychologist
says, “Any theory of consciousness has to be able to explain why a person like that, who’s
missing 90 percent of his neurons, still exhibits normal behavior” (Goldhill, 2016). Those
regions the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes in the brain control motion,
sensibility, language, vision, audition, and emotional and cognitive functions were all
reduced in the Frenchman. He did not, however, suffer significant mental effects, suggesting
that, if an injury occurs slowly over time, the brain can adapt to survive despite major damage
in these regions. In other words, it’s unlikely that one specific region on its own is going to be
responsible for consciousness (Goldhill, 2016).
In his Nobel acceptance lecture in 1981, Roger Sperry, who was awarded the Prize for
Physiology or Medicine, argued that his research and that of his collaborators had
demonstrated that the right hemisphere of split-brain patients had a rich cognitive and
emotional life that might be said to rival that of the left hemisphere in many respects (Sperry,
1982). This cemented the belief that two consciousnesses may exist side by side (Koch,
2004). Uddin found a split-brain patient could recognize her own face equally well whether
presented to her left or right hemisphere, indicating basic self-awareness in both hemispheres
(Uddin, 2010). The duality model is the simplest model of split-brain consciousness. The
basic idea is clear and easy to understand: If we divide the brain, then the stream of
consciousness is also divided. These two phenomenal fields are not unified synchronically
(Hayashi, 2014). Meanwhile, the duality side has to explain not only that chimeric experience
but also unified ordinary behavior of split-brain subjects (Hayashi, 2014). Even without
massive communication between the cerebral hemispheres, and thus increased modularity,
unity in consciousness and responding is largely preserved. This preserved unity of

consciousness may be especially challenging for the two currently most dominant theories of
consciousness, the Global Workspace theory and the Integration Information Theory (Pinto,
2017).
But I think that consciousness is a new form of energy which exists for the benefit of all
the other forms of energy in the brain and the body. Various studies are presented to illustrate
how human consciousness and intentionality can generate subtle energy fields that are
translated into electromagnetic fields having significant biochemical and physiologic effects.
Such subtle energies can also be stored in an electrical device and utilized to change the pH
of a solution, increase the in vitro thermodynamic activity of enzymes and increase the in
vivo ratio of ATP to ADP in developing fruit fly larvae to significantly reduce the maturation
time to adult flies (Rosch, 2015).
Research to date has shown that cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment evokes
a change in the EEG pattern of every person to whom it is applied. CES induces significant
changes in the EEG. It increases alpha (8–12 Hz) relative power, and decreases relative
power in the delta (0–3.5 Hz) and beta (12.5–30 Hz) frequencies (Kennerly, 2004). Increased
alpha correlates with improved relaxation and increased mental alertness or clarity.
Decreased delta waves indicate a reduction in fatigue. Beta wave reductions from 20–30 Hz
correlate with decreases in anxiety, ruminative thoughts, and obsessive/compulsive-like
behaviors (Rosch, 2015).
The act of consciousness demonstrates both wakefulness and awareness. The wakefulness
and consciousness are not one and the same is apparent when we consider the neurological
condition known as vegetative state. Patients in a vegetative state have no manifestation
suggestive of consciousness. Like patients in the similar but more grave situation of coma,
vegetative patients fail to respond to any message from the examiners and offer no
spontaneous signs of awareness of self or surroundings. And yet their electroencephalograms,
or EEGs (the electrical wave patterns continuously produced by a living brain), reveal
alternating patterns characteristic of either sleep or wakefulness. Along with wake-pattern
EEGs, patients will often have their eyes open, although they stare vacantly into space, not
directing their gaze to any particular object. No such electrical pattern is noted when patients
are in coma, a situation in which all phenomena associated with consciousness (wakefulness,
mind, and self) appear to be absent (Damasio, 2010).
EXTERNAL STIMULI AND INTERNAL STIMULI

As we know that neurons communicate through electrochemical activity. Stimuli from the
external world enter the neural network through physical energies (mechanical, acoustic,
light) transduced by sensory cells. In addition to changes in internal state, the brain can affect
the body by control of hormones as well as by control of muscles, which can also serve to
effect interactions with the external world ranging from simple reflexes to complex sequences
of gestures (Arbib, 2013). As the activity level in the brain stem decreases, the source of
pattern propagation (transmission) to the sensory systems of the brain switches in dominance
from external to internal (Hobson, 1989, 1994; Kissin, 1986). As we pay less attention to
information coming through our senses externally, we are able to pay more attention to
internal information resulting from the dynamic interplay between internally replicated
patterns in the brain called memory, which are influenced in part by the external environment
(Furman, 2000). This change in brain activity can be readily seen on an EEG, which
measures extracellular magnetic waves (Nunez, 1995). Thus, faculties such as visualization,
memory, attention, and volition will be accessible at one activity level (frequency) and not at
another. This can be thought of as a fundamental phase transition from one activity level to
another where each activity level represents a discrete attractor landscape and its state-bound
attractors (Haken & Koepchen, 1991; Haken, 1983, 1988). As the activity level in the brain
stem decreases, there is a switch in dominance between norepinephrine (NE) and
acetylcholine (ACh). As NE decreases and ACh increases, visual images become more vivid
and the ability to voluntarily direct our own attention and exert volition decrease (Hobson,
1989, 1994; Kissin, 1986).
It would be consistent with what is understood about reality at the sub-atomic level to say
that the smallest ‘particles’ known are actually fields of energy rather than ‘solid’ material
(Davies & Gribbin, 1991). This realm of prephysicality is not only the basis of the physical
world and of matter, but also seems to be connected to, consciousness, which some see as the
fundamental field underlying it (Bohm, 1980; Hagelin, 1987; Goswami, 1989, 1993, 1994;
Shacklett, 1991; Gough & Shacklett, 1993; Laszlo, 1995, 1996; Friedman, 1997;
Grandpierre, 1997). This hidden domain can be considered as a fundamental dimension of
reality, a domain of dynamical connectivity, from which the patterns of the physical world
arise. The ‘hidden domain’ of connectivity has characteristics completely different from those
of the classical, macroscopic world of separated objects. For a long time, the quantum
description that reveals the properties of phenomena belonging to this domain, or arising
from it, was taken to apply only to the microscopic world of atoms and molecules, while the
world of macroscopic phenomena of our experience was considered to be purely classical and

not to manifest quantum properties. However, today we know that this is not true, and that
there are many macroscopic quantum manifestations, although our knowledge about them is
still limited (Leggett, 1986, 1992, 1996; De Martino et al., 1997; Sassaroli et al., 1998).
Biological systems obviously possess the characteristics of macroscopic quantum systems
(Popp & Beloussov, 2003). At first it may appear unlikely that a complex system with many
degrees of freedom like the brain could be modelled with the right causal dynamics, but
without taking into account the smallest parts. Micro stimulation of individual neurons can
influence sensory decisions (Houweling & Brecht, 2008), showing that very small
disturbances can – under the right circumstances – scale up to behavioral divergences.
However, state variables of complex systems can be quantitatively predicted when there is
‘scale separation’: when different aspects of the system exist on sufficiently (orders of
magnitude) different scales (of size, energy, time etc.), they can become uncoupled
(Hillerbrand, 2008). While practically all neuroscientists subscribe to the dogma that neural
activity is a phenomenon that occurs on a classical scale, there have been proposals (mainly
from physicists) that quantum effects play an important role in the function of the brain
(Penrose, 1989; Hameroff, 1987). So far there is no evidence for quantum effects in the brain
beyond quantum chemistry, and no evidence that such effects play an important role for
intelligence or consciousness (Litt et al., 2006). There is no lack of possible computational
primitives in neurobiology nor any phenomena that appear unexplainable in terms of classical
computations (Koch & Hepp, 2006). Quantitative estimates for decoherence times for ions
during action potentials and microtubules suggest that they decohere on a timescale of 10 -20 –
10-13 s, about ten orders of magnitude faster than the normal neural activity timescales. Hence
quantum effects are unlikely to persist long enough to affect processing (Tegmark, 2000). But
there may be mechanisms protecting quantum superpositions over significant periods (Rosa
& Faber, 2004; Hagan & Hameroff et al., 2002).
Quantum effects do indeed appear to play a role in biological function. Electron
superpositions have been shown to influence nuclear movement suggesting that quantum
superposition, of various possible protein conformations, occurs before one is selected
(Conrad, 1994). Functional protein vibrations, which depend on quantum effects, have been
shown in two hydrophobic phenylalanine residues (Roitberg, 1995), and evidence also
suggests quantum coherent states exist in the protein ferritin (Tejada, 1996). More recently,
Matsuno has claimed to observe magnetic quantum coherence in actin, a main component of
the contractile apparatus in muscle cells, and of the cytoskeleton in all cells (Matsuno, 2001).
Close examination of effects of general anesthetics (which erase consciousness) and

hallucinogens (which are said to expand consciousness) reveal that both act in opposite ways
on delicate quantum effects (Hameroff, 2002). Sahu et al. (Sahu, 2013) have shown apparent
quantum resonance effects in single microtubules in gigahertz, megahertz and kilohertz
vibrations. Quantum coherence in plant photosynthesis, magnetoreception in birds, the
human sense of smell (Lambert, 2013), and individual photon effects in vision (Fleming,
2011) suggest a significant role for quantum mechanisms throughout biology. Quantum
superposition requires a physical system (e.g. electron dipoles) to occupy two or more states
or locations simultaneously, and avoid ‘decoherence’ by random interactions with a polar
environment. Non-polar, hydrophobic media such as arrays of pi resonance clouds enable
electron mobility, dipole oscillations and spread of the quantum wave function, minimizing
decoherence effects from polar media. Evidence shows that anesthetics slow the movement
of free electrons in a corona discharge (Hameroff, 1983).
THOUGHT MECHANISM AND CONSCIOUSNESS
The application of quantum mechanics of consciousness state that the energy levels of the
field become discrete or ‘quantized.’ Unlike a classical field, whose propagating waves can
have any amplitude and can thereby possess arbitrary energy, the stable propagating states of
a quantum field of consciousness are constrained to have discrete energies (Hagelin, 1987).
Therefore, consciousness is a form of energy in various states of manifestation and
transformation. Our consciousness defines our perspectives that how we explore the field of
energy and how we store them in our brain basically through the conscious/unconscious
thought mechanism. Per hour thousands of thoughts come and go, and only those thoughts
which have been given more attention douse into a pool of consciousness to get life. Majority
of the thoughts aren’t invited by our conscious mind; they come and fade upon their own.
Even though some of the thoughts may be disturbing and exhausting that initially we have to
suppress them before they can grow. The suppressing of such thoughts also takes
considerable concentration, time and causations when they are suppressed by another thought
or action. Negative thought patterns can physically damage our brain and our positive
thinking can repair the brain. Our way of thinking may differ from others but we are same
humans with same speed of thoughts travelling on our neural highways. Only the thing that
matters is the kind of thoughts travelling, and thereafter, we are bringing them out into what
type of actions (Rizvi, 2016). Although thought and consciousness are interwoven in a
mutually dependent process and it is through consciousness we better understand and know

the world rather the thought which is only a perceptual mechanism. Thought does not “just
find mechanistic structures in the world, it creates them out of its own necessity” (Ross,
2008). A thought is directly generated by external stimuli while our brain acts as an electronic
machine propelled by the neural energy to process the stimuli.
The neural processing of information is metabolically expensive (Kety, 1957; Sokoloff,
1960; Rolfe & Brown, 1997). In the average adult, the brain is about 2 % of the body weight,
although the energy required to maintain its functions amounts to about 20 % of its resting
metabolic rate (McKenna et al., 2006). Remarkably, the metabolic activity of the brain is
constant over time, despite variation in mental and motor performances. This is explained by
the fact that the resting state normally needs considerable energy for maintaining membrane
potentials. Approximately 75 % of energy utilized by brain is related to signaling, whereas
the remaining 25 % of energy consumption serves to maintain indispensable nonsignaling
cellular activity, including protein synthesis and degradation, nucleotide turnover,
axoplasmic transport, and mitochondrial proton leak (Attwell & Laughlin, 2001). This
requirement for metabolic energy has important implications for the brain’s evolution and
function. The availability of energy could limit brain size, particularly in primates (Aiello
and Wheeler, 1995), and could determine a brain’s circuitry and activity patterns by favoring
metabolically efficient wiring patterns (Mitchison, 1992; Koulakov & Chklovskii, 2001) and
neural codes (Levy & Baxter, 1996; Baddeley et al., 1997; Balasubramanian et al., 2001).
Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that the neural
correlates of consciousness can be better interpreted in the light of a bidimensional model,
based on the two different axes: the objective level and subjective content of consciousness
(Cavanna et al., 2011; Laureys et al., 2004; Monaco et al., 2005; Nani & Cavanna, 2012).
Within this framework, the level evaluates the structures necessary for control of the
quantitative features of consciousness, while the content addresses the structures involved in
producing the qualitative features of subjective awareness (Blumenfeld, 2009; Plum &
Posner, 1980; Zeman, 2001). The level of arousal reflects the degree of wakefulness, which
can range from full alertness through drowsiness and sleep to coma (Baars et al., 2003;
Laureys & Boly, 2008). The functional and structural integrity of ascending pontomesodiencephalic reticular pathways and widespread thalamocortical projections is essential
for igniting and maintaining the level of consciousness (Steriade, 1996a, b). The contents of
conscious experience are composed of sensations, emotions, thoughts, memories, intentions,
and all the feelings that color our inner world (“qualia” in neuro-philosophical terms). The
contents are likely to be determined by the interaction between exogenous factors coming

from the environment and endogenous factors (e.g., focal attention). Subjective experiences
are also bound to visceromotor reactions and are accompanied by a degree of emotional
salience, which appears to be modulated by temporolimbic activity (Critchley, 2005;
Johanson et al., 2003).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Before we may hypothesize the creation of consciousness in any specific region of the brain
we must first prove the existence of consciousness. Now please read the table given below:

The above table states that ‘consit’ is a hypothetical elementary particle that mediates the
force of consciousness in the framework of quantum field theory of the brain. If it exists, the
consit is expected to be massless (because the consciousness force appears to have unlimited
range) and must be a spin-2 boson.
Spin is a very fundamental quantum process associated with the structure of space-time
(Dirac, 1928; Penrose, 1967). Indeed, modern physics leads us right down to the microscopic
domain of space-time where various models of elementary particles and even space-time
itself are built with spinors (Budinich, 2002). On the other hand, neural membranes are
saturated with spin-carrying nuclei such as 1H, 13C and 31P. Indeed, both MRI and fMRI are

based on the abundance of 1H in human body. Neural membranes are matrices of brain
electrical activities and play vital roles in the normal functions of a conscious brain and their
major molecular components are phospholipids, proteins and cholesterols. Each phospholipid
contains 1 31P, 1.8% 13C and over 60 1H its lipid chains. Similarly, neural membrane proteins
such as ion channels and neural transmitter receptors also contain large clusters of spin
carrying nuclei. Therefore, we strongly believe that Nature has utilized quantum spin in
constructing a conscious mind (Wu, 2007). On the theoretical front, there are quite a few
quantum theories of mind (Penrose, 1989; Donald, 1990; Stapp, 1993; Penrose, 1994;
Hameroff, 1996). Among these, Penrose’s Objective Reduction (“OR”) together with
Hameroff’s microtubule computation is perhaps the most popular, and the combination of the
two produced the Orchestrated Objective Reduction (“Orch OR”) in microtubules (Penrose,
1989; Penrose, 1994; Hameroff, 1996). According to Penrose, each quantum state has its own
space-time geometry, thus superposition of quantum states entails superposition of different
space-time geometries (Penrose, 1989; Penrose, 1994). Under certain conditions, such spacetime geometric superposition would separate under its own “weight” through a noncomputable process, which in turn would collapse said quantum state superposition (Penrose,
1989; Penrose, 1994). Hameroff suggested that such self-organized OR could occur in
microtubules because of their particular structures, thus, born the Orch OR. According Orch
OR, each collapse of macroscopic space-time geometry superposition corresponds to a
discrete conscious event. In addition, it seems that Penrose accepts a separate mental world
with grounding in the physical world (Penrose, 1989; Penrose, 1994).
Another commonly held view is that consciousness is unrelated to quantum mechanics
because the brain is a wet, warm system where decoherence destroys quantum superpositions
of neuron firing much faster than we can think, preventing our brain from acting as a
quantum computer (Tegmark, 2015). No doubt there are important quantum mechanical
behaviors within ion channels and within synapses and elsewhere, since ions and their
electrons are small and subject to quantum theory. One interesting hypothesis suggests
quantum computing within the microtubules of neurons, proposed to generate higher
consciousness (Hameroff, 2003; 2007). Others see quantum tunnelling of electrons between
synapses as creating consciousness (Walker, 2000). The coherence of such quantum states
among brain proteins has been suggested to lead to material changes in brain physiology
through orchestrated collapse of quantum coherent clusters of tubulin proteins, triggered by
quantum gravity expressed at the spin (Planck scale) level. On the basis of a recent theory on
the nature of gravity (Verlinde, 2011), postulating that gravity is not a force but rather an

entropic compensation for the movement of mass/information, it was speculated that
consciousness may arise from a gravity-mediated reaction on the entropic displacement of
information as it occurs in high density in the human brain (Meijer, 2012). But no such
particles and forces have been identified that could produce consciousness. The effect that
quantum coherence in the brain would be too short lived to have a functional role in neural
processing (Tegmark, 2000). Quantum-coherent oscillations are difficult to demonstrate on
living systems—heat effects, due to resonance in thermal frequency modes, all too readily
intrude, jumbling the experimental picture (Loewenstein, 1999).
The brain is an electrochemical organ; and speculations are that a fully functioning brain
can generate as much as 10 watts of electrical power. Electrical activity emanating from the
brain is displayed in brainwaves (Herrmann, 2006). The higher the frequency of our brain
waves, the higher our consciousness. Our brain waves are governed by the same rules of
quantum mechanics and by the same equations governing the electromagnetic spectrum,
light, particles and everything in the universe. Theta oscillations are defined as activity in the
4 to 8 Hz range, the alpha rhythm operates in the 9 to 12 Hz range, while beta oscillations
occur around 20 Hz. Gamma oscillations are produced when masses of neurons fire at around
40 Hz but can occur as low as 26 Hz to upwards of 70 Hz. It has been argued that transient
periods of synchronized firing over the gamma waveband of neurons from different parts of
the brain may integrate various cognitive processes to generate a concerted act of perception
(Fries, 2009). Conscious perception is also accompanied by increases in power and
synchrony in the gamma band (>30Hz) (Schurger et al., 2006; Melloni et al., 2007; Doesburg
et al., 2009; Wyart & Tallon-Baudry, 2009). A small number of studies have, however, also
found fronto-parietal activation and gamma activity during unconscious processing of
sensory stimuli (Diaz & McCarthy, 2007; Luo et al., 2009). In the alpha and low beta bands
(10–20Hz), long-distance phase synchrony shows consistent changes for consciousnessrelated activity (Gross et al., 2004; Gaillard et al., 2009; Hipp et al., 2011). More generally,
consciousness-related activations are frequently found in higher-order sensory areas (Tong et
al., 1998; Grill-Spector et al., 2000) and in bilateral parietal and pre-frontal cortical areas
(Dehaene et al., 2001; Lau & Passingham, 2006; Boly et al., 2007a; Farrer et al., 2008;
Desmurget & Sirigu, 2009; Sadaghiani et al., 2009; Bor & Seth, 2012; Tse et al., 2005;
Tallon-Baudry, 2011). Presently, a number of studies suggest that conscious perception may
not be necessary for the operation of various complex cognitive processes, such as attention
(Koch & Tsuchiya, 2007), cognitive control (van Gaal et al., 2011), conflict monitoring (van
Gaal et al., 2010), volition (Soon et al., 2008), arithmetic (Sklar et al., 2012), or feature

binding (Mudrik et al., 2011), and semantic analysis (Kouider & Dehaene, 2007; Kang et al.,
2011). It is important to remember, however, that the effect size of these complex cognitive
processes in the absence of consciousness is typically much smaller, compared to that
obtained in the presence of consciousness (van Gaal & Lamme, 2012). Even consciousness
demands energy to keep its mechanism working, and to keep us conscious. While the brain is
a high energy-consuming organ, it contains little energy reserves and is therefore highly
dependent upon the uninterrupted supply of energy substrates from the circulation.
Impairment in this process results in perturbation of neurological functions, loss of
consciousness, and coma within minutes. As already mentioned, brain cells can efficiently
utilize various energy substrates in addition to glucose, including lactate, pyruvate, glutamate,
and glutamine (Zielke et al., 2009).
When we become conscious then it increases signals in our brain. When the signals are
increased (e.g. signals are the complex behavior of ion channels on the branches of the
neurons) then they contribute to the shape of brain waves, and the physical stimuli that gave
rise to the signals no longer available. For example, if we add neural energy by recalling a
memory or by adding a new memory then the mass of the memory may increase at each
recall or addition, and if the neural energy is taken away from the neuron, it decreases its
mass. This clearly shows that consciousness (or consit) is interdependent on the brain waves
in distinct distributed proportions. But the brain waves are not consciousness. From this
separate probability distribution, we may find out the arbitrary conditional probabilities of
one set of consciousness given another set of brain waves. Calculating these conditionals
may help us to define the inference problem for the mechanism of consciousness.
According to the integrated information theory of consciousness, any physical system will
have subjective experience to the extent that it is capable of integrating information. In this
view, experience, i.e. information integration, is a fundamental quantity that is, in principle,
measurable, just as mass or energy is. Information and integration are, on the other hand, the
very essence of subjective experience. Indeed, the theory claims that the level of
consciousness of a physical system is related to the repertoire of different states (information)
that can be discriminated by the system as a whole (integration). (Balduzzi & Tononi, 2008;
Tononi, 2004). The level of tension across the neural networks determines the state of
consciousness. The type and volume of traffic over those networks determines the
experiences of consciousness (Ross, 2009). In human brain, cognition and consciousness are,
at any one time, thought to involve tens of thousands of neurons. Hebb’s (1949) ‘cell
assemblies’, Eccles’s (1992) ‘modules’, and Crick and Koch’s (1990) ‘coherent sets of

neurons’ are each estimated to contain some 10,000 to 100,000 neurons which may be widely
distributed throughout the brain (Scott, 1995).
As long as we add more neurons, we will need more speed and energy to recall or recycle
them, and this will repeat in an endless cycle. Neural electromagnetic waves do not, of
course, travel at the speed of light, about 30 cm/ns in free space. In the axon of a neuron,
electromagnetic speeds are closer to 30 nm/ns, because of the low current densities from
ionic current sources and the high capacitance per unit area of a membrane (Burger, 2009).
As much distance a signal (e.g. neural electromagnetic waves) would travel in the brain its
mass would increase and this would eventually slow its speed. As the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation decreases, the amount of energy it emits increases (McDowell,
2015). Memory is enhanced not only by the rate of spike firing but equally by their relative
timing. The spiking of neurons in the hippocampus and the visual cortex with which it
interacts are greatly influenced by synchronous oscillations of brain waves (Sejnowski &
Delbruck, 2012). Synaptic transmission and axonal transfer of nerve impulses are too slow to
organize coordinated activity in large areas of the central nervous system. Numerous
observations confirm this view (Reinis et al., 2005). The duration of a synaptic transmission
is at least 0.5 ms, thus the transmission across thousands of synapses takes about hundreds or
even thousands of milliseconds. The transmission speed of action potentials varies between
0.5 m/s and 120 m/s along an axon. More than 50% of the nerves fibers in the corpus
callosum are without myelin, thus their speed is reduced to 0.5 m/s. How can these low
velocities (i.e. classical signals) explain the fast processing in the nervous system? (Musha,
2009) Additionally, there exist other energy states of both optical and vibrational nature
(Jelínek & Pokorný, 2001; Pokorný et al., 1997; Deriu et al., 2010) which tubulin and the
whole microtubule can support. These states can be excited by energy supply provided by
mitochondria (Cifra et al., 2010). If these states are discovered then they may help us to solve
“how neuronal synchrony, e.g. gamma synchrony EEG (30 to 90 Hz), the best measurable
correlate of consciousness does not derive from neuronal firings” (Penrose, 2011).
Consciousness is an active force or mechanism that can, among other things, control or cause
change in the human energy field, as well as, potentially, the universal field. Consciousness is
a four or higher-dimensional force. Recent work in physics seems to indicate that higher
dimensional forces may be at work (Lansky, 2011).

CONCLUSION

In this paper I proposed a new theory based on the energy production in the conscious
process that is complementary with existing theories. This theory argues that consciousness
exists in the brain/body as a discrete form of energy.
