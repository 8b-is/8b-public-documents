SUMMARY
ON CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION
1/4 - One of the largest branches of research on consciousness and the unconscious,
rose Benjamín Lisbeth, with his experiments between the 1960s and 1980s about free
will and consciousness. After half a century, it awakened by our debate, but the results
remain consistent. Additional to that joins the hard problem of measurement, which
has a century of studies, research and debates.
-----------2-4 - Implications of metabolism, the anatomical, electrodynamic communication,
process information, cellular levels and sublevels, in colloids, microtubules, molecules,
membranes, synapse, etc., has fostered research in humans and animals. Since decades,
studies in the pre-sinapsis, memory and quantum phenomena, which have led to
cooperate to quantum physics at the neuronal level, as before in molecular biology
have increased.
----------------3/4 - Other basic problems in the psychological, social, health sciences, refer to
principles that guide human acts, decisions, reasoned thinking and behavior. From the
1960s and 1970s, experimental studies on consciousness and the bases underpinning its
operation have increased. Among them are the theories of quantum physics, with
relative success.
--------------4/4 - The ways of these studies, descend from the classic brain level, up to the levels
bio-molecular, micro-tubular, dendrites, many and even the supra sensitive. Authors
as diverse as sir John Carew Eccles, Henry Stapp, sir Roger Penrose, Giuseppe Vitiello,
Frollich, Umezawa, Jeffrey Goldstone, David Deutsch, among many as you can see
have undertaken this work.

CHAPTER I. introduction.
1.-95- A fundamental problem in the health sciences, psychological and social, refers to
the principles guiding the cognitive acts and human behavior, decision making,
subjectivity, and behavior. From the 1960s, experimental studies have increased. These
should be based on models, empirical solids, avoiding abstract theories by desiderata
written or mathematical and experimental data.
2-- Roads have descended from the cerebral level, up to the levels bio molecular, microtubular, dendrites and the quantum. We are going to try to synthesize relation to
quantum theories, that undertake it authors as diverse as Wheeler, sir John Carew
Eccles, Henry Stapp, Roger Penrose and others such as Giuseppe Vitiello, Umezawa,
Jeffrey Goldstone or David Deutsch, Zhang, in theories about the brain, among
many. This may involve new theories of consciousness and psychological. (van Gaal S.

3 - Since the 19th century, William James, by the 1890, initially considered the
conscience as a sequence of moments and had her doubts. Alfred N. Whitehead, 1929,
1933, described consciousness as a sequence of discrete event called "occasions of
experience". The theory of the "moment of perception" of Stroud and Freeman,
described consciousness as a discrete event, with sequences of a film. (Freeman WJ.
2006). Newly Herzog H et al., (2016), give conscistencia.

----------------4 - Consciousness escapes and has not been able to arrive at a consensual
definition. More or less, we all know that we have consciousness, but we can
sometimes be confused with know, remember, have cognition, etc., with not
phenomenal consciousness, according to philosophers, what feelings, subjectivity,
reflection, creativity and the "qualia", between others. (Chalmers DJ, 1993). (Gray j. a.
2004). (Churchland P. S. 1981) (Strawson, g. 2006) (Wegner, D. M. 2002).
5 - Nothing us has surprising studies of consciousness, the mind or similar ideas,
which have always been very long-standing historical speculation objects by that have
intrigued. To our knowledge, some early references are the ethnographies, the myths,
the philosophy of Gautama Siddhartha, (the first psychological reference) - the Vedas,
Greeks, etc. (J Nehru, 1989) (A. Hirakawa, 1935-1990, w. Durant. 1935, J Campbell,

Lotka 1932, von Neumann, 1935, London, 1939, etc. Even the quantum micro-fisico this
bonding is observed. This has created many groups and research teams and

7 -95- In recent decades has been given also attention to the phenomena of
consciousness and very quick responses with existing technologies. For example, when
playing ping pong in raqueteos very rapid, rapid strokes between two fighters, the
talks, changing translations simultaneous, aviation, tennis, etc., long, up to the flies,

8 - A splitting of the experiments of Benjamín Libet and colleagues (Libet et al., 1964,
1985, 2004.), it was noted that brain networks were unconscious operations, to
voluntary actions, and 100 ms 500 ms before, that consciousness knows them and
is execute the action. They have been replicated in Germany by scientists from the Max
Planck Institute, confirming that seconds before consciousness, the stimulus is
processed in an unconscious way. (C. Soon et al., 2008, 2013, 2015). (J. D. Haynes et al.

09 - All this means that the brain was initiating the process unconsciously, to less 100
ms 500 Ms until delivered him to consciousness the results of actions to perform. It was
also observed that consciousness can inhibit or veto these unconscious processes by
Lisbeth and Haynes. (J. D. Haynes et al. 2016). All of the above has implications for free
will and the temporal. (Hameroff, Stuart., 2012). (W, James, 1904) (Haggard, p.
2008). (Matsuhashi, M. 2008). (F, Itzhak et col. 2011)

10-To be of this paradox, the philosophers Dennett and Kinsbourne (1991-1992), they
write that perception and action in real time, is as a realization evoked, executed as a
mere illusion. Even memorizes judgment of actions in 200 or 500 ms or are as false
memories. B. Libet adds, "consciousness, can veto or inhibit the unconscious action
judgment". (Strawson, 2006).

13 - They called this effect "Pre-Feeling", why subjects did not have any knowledge of
emotional images before your presentation, on the computer. The non-conscious
emotional feelings (feelings) referred back in time. Similar to a type of common
memory. (Achtenberg, j. et al.2005.) (Persinger, M.A., 1983, 2010). These experiments
have followed in abundance, Gian et students have carried out nearly 90. (Bem D. J.,

14-In recent articles S, Dehaene, col., his team and others, (2017), with magnetografia,
are checking, the memory of work, --suggested as involved only in consciousness, -has been also detected that it can operate in moments before unconscious, along with
other details, more checking of our unconscious role in cognition and
consciousness. This memory has been called the silent memory. (Stokes MG.
2015) (Soto, 2011, 2014). It would be a new paradigm and other previous, involving

-----------15 - We can estimate calculations of the brain needs. This must compute immense
quantities of data for a discrete idea of the realities that we observe, and the world of
the universe, who is constantly changing. This is a world of particles and waves at its
basic level.
-----------------16. Our mind-body with the brain must compute a whole universe of external or
environment and their own internal environment. Both are open dynamic systems,
inter-related and inter-actuantes. At the same time, both systems are composed of
myriads of inter-related sub-systems. Each of them is a universe of many changing. We
should treat these systems with the theories of systems.
-----------------17 - This brain must simultaneously monitor and calculate the incoming stimuli,
classify, encode, and self-archive hieratic and hierarchical in memory for the processes
of the same brain, instant in instant. Simultaneously perform the calculations, with
incoming stimuli and memory, mental representations in non-psychological internal
codes. It is a dense and cerebral neural reality operational.
---------------18-95 - Every moment at the same time, in milliseconds, represented at psychological
images trains incoming stimuli. These stimuli at the same time, by the interrelationships, may be modifying the internal state. Many computations required
simultaneous and successive, in addition to the homeostatic balance of the mind-body.
---------------19 - To build this psychological reality, to construct a simulated reality, with
comparisons of each incoming stimulus, with the stored memory, detail to detail, in the
unconscious, bit or qubit. (Estimated from J A, Wheeler and D, Deutsch for the
information of the universe).

20 - May be quadrillion bits in memory. The incoming stimulus has to do with the
external environment of Schrödinger, in cuatrillonesimas seconds and changing,
coupled with interoceptiva internal information.
--------------21 - According to what we know, when compared to the current Super-computadores
and quantum computers, these calculations may be on orders of Exa-Flops by
thousand or a hundred thousand. All this tends to suggest the need for calculations in
series and simultaneous quantum of myriads of computations and integration. See
paragraph 48 and 52, brain operations, for greater exposure.

scientific experiments. -among hundreds - that have been deducted and confirming
electromagnetic, quantum phenomena in other experiments, which induces the
physicists cooperate increasingly, more in the phenomena of the mind, as before in
molecular biology. These are increasingly the phenomena of the world micro-fisico in
the brain.

functions: "... Most refined in a temporary high and smaller spatial scale. "
25 - Such faster activities on a smaller scale could include gradients of intra-neuronales
ions, molecular patterns in reaction-diffusion, dynamics of actin, glycolysis,
Ribosomes, microtubule cyto-skeletal information processing, and other
mechanisms. You suggest that consciousness depends also on scale processes in the
area of the brain quantum physics.

CHAPTER IV - PENROSE AND HAMEROFF
31-95 - In the years 1989 and 1994, Penrose writes two books that attracted some in the
scientific community, and other skeptics. Extra at the end of the Decade of the 1990s
and into the 21st century, many other works began to show more fields of quanta EDQ
and QFT phenomena and process information and intercom in brain cells. Hameroff,
who matched Penrose meet very favorable for both forces.

32 - Penrose tells us: that is not visible to consciousness as algorithmic or linear, nor
less as an Epi-phenomenal phenomenon.
"In this sense, the fundamental stance could see consciousness as a phenomenon nothing
algorithm mechanistic, - partly - dependent quantum activity, together with the NCC. "Rather
it is to take into account the calculations in the brain, occurring at the level of the molecular and
physical quantum, which prevents described it"Epi-phenomenal"to this position". (Roger
Penrose.) 1994. Shadow of Mind. Oxford University Press).

------------33 Penrose and Hameroff proposed that consciousness involves quantum calculations
synchronized brain gamma frequencies, microtubules and in networks of
dendrites. They suggested to also resolve the "hard problem" of consciousness,
proposing precursors or components of consciousness and the "qualia", which are
foundations of reality (e.g., spin, mass or load). These qualia can be accessed by
quantum processes, proposed in the microtubules.

35-95 - Gamma synchrony differentiates between conscious perception and the
unconscious of the word, "aware" of the dream dreams seemingly dreamless. Another
distinction between conscious and unconscious processing happens in subjects with
certain areas of the visual cortex lesions. Blind vision patients have unconscious vision,
for example, cognitively reacting to objects that do not "see" consciously. This suggests
the role of gamma waves in consciousness and fields of QFT.

occur each time with moments of consciousness. The hypothesis of processing in the

frequencies, and higher (Sahu et al., 2012). With approximately 10 ^ 9 tubulins, per
neuron, by 10 MHz (10 ^ 7), the potential capacity of processing in microtubules is 10 ^

maximum capacities up to 10 ^ 26 op. s. (Bandyopadhyay. 2011)

ideas, recently are to be found in Hegel, Kant, Chardin, Russell, Bergson, etc., long, or

mental activity is a process "monotonous and repetitive". In that we are like
zombies. Whitehead believed the mind of high level, are States of Consciousness on

Whitehead is feasible. (Shimony, 1993) (Stapp, 1993, 2005). (Stroud, J. M.

CHAPTER V – Brain Process
48 -95- We will try to see bird flight, as we understand these complexities of brain
operations for cognition, an inner and outer world of many. How much "Quanta
Computer QC, together with Neuro computing conscious NCC, and prediction of the
dynamic systems of the environment and of the classical world macro and
micro." Remember that cognition are nonlinear Computable predictions. A
bibliography at this end.
------------------------49 - In a world so variable, with comparisons to the previous memory similar to
represent the world we see and feel, every moment. Also need a machine to calculate,
with the NCC. See: what is life? (Schrödinger, 1944, online), and, for the NCC
Barsalou. (L, W Barsalou. 2007). Schrödinger, this 60-page book he wrote for the public.
Is in English and Spanish online.
-------------50 - Quantum computing and artificial intelligence in computers, as crude analogies,
help us to understand this world so sophisticated. Remember that artificial intelligence
is to imitate human intelligence, so support. (S. E. Palm. 2015). (Marslen-Wilson. 2017).
------------51 - The incoming data are compared with memory, an entry, a rise, fall, re-entrante,
ascent, descent, to stabilize a "precept". Then with each precept, repeated operations,
and so on, at very fast speeds that depend on levels and meta-niveles of cognition and
consciousness delivery. (Scharnowski f. 2016) (Herzog. 2016)

-----------------------TRY TO EXPAND.
52 -95- When you have to analyze one or more incoming stimuli, these are dynamic, for
example, reflected light, changes at every turn, so the brain has to stabilize the colors
that we see are psychological ontic, that is not the real thing.
-------------53 - The reality that we perceive is psychological ontic. The stimuli can be sound and
others. The sensations are multiple changing stimuli, that at the same time have to
integrate and consolidate a stable Percept in every moment.
------------54 - When we speak of the percepts, - as a static picture - they are stable, adapted to the
human representations. There has been an idea that are about 50 per second. But those
built by the unconscious are far greater in number and density.
-----------------55 - We humans are beings emotional and sentimental, why we live in a changing
dynamic world, which produces emotions from very faint or imperceptible, to our
consciousness, to the strong. So the feelings are also produced.
-----------56 - As many senses and the interoceptive multi-sensory and dynamic, the memory is
something special. Then, is it archived long term. In this space of input stimuli and the
archived image, there are thousands and thousands of operations, departing from
these notes.
----------57 -95- The brain appears to have no specific integration Center of this multi-sensory
and dynamic information for diversity and multiple stimuli which must specify and
encode at the same time.
----------58. At the same time, it is receiving, you are calculating, delivering percepts and
analyzing the flow of incoming information. This gives us the idea of the needs of
calculations and simultaneous media by thousands and thousands. It has also been
suggested that each neuron can calculate or compute.

59. To where we know the analysis of incoming information, you can start with one or
two neurons, then you can use another, and so on, to use connections to many other
networks, multi level, mini-columnas or micro areas or meso areas or macro areas.
--------60. In this form you are building simulations up and down, successive and
simultaneous, to more or less stable images to deliver to the conscious cognition, and
follow. Our brain works twenty-four hours, even sleeping. It is a continuous process
flow.
-----------------61 -95- Dendrites and neurons, connections, joints gap, synapses, etc., are not fixed, are
therefore made connections in series or parallel, many simultaneous hundreds or
millions to simultaneous, etc., at the time, and then disappear the connections to stop
perceiving. This is another never imagined itself and amazing complexity.
------------62 - The brain seems to be a very complex tool, nothing is static, with a hardware and
software totally flexible, unconventional and very far from classical computing. A very
precise dynamic connections structure adapted to the universal environment where it
was developed. A great gift of nature. The body is very complex, and if we look at it
next to the brain, we doubt this gift.
---------------63 - You must construct a dozen or more stable images, to deliver to the conscious
cognition psychological. The speed with which must operate in a dynamic and
changing, to arrive at results, sometimes required operations on the order of one
hundred or thousand, EXA-FLOPS. (10-21). Penrose and Hameroff have estimated up
to a maximum of 10-16 by neuron and 10-26 operations for seconds of the entire brain.
-----------------64 -95- These data already give us an idea of the need for quantum computing to levels
of the brain. Why, metabolic and NCC, operations may be slow in comparison.
------------------65 - The experimental data suggests that he is computed quantum-shaped in the presinapsis of neurons, where it is also suggested that memory is stored. (E Kendal. 2000,
2015)
-----------66 - A wider exposure is out of the limitations of these notes, but we can suggest that
quantum theories promise to better explain the psychological world, that classic. The
same mathematics are better for open dynamic systems.

67 - A suggestion out of line by inference, is that NC could hold the "stable successive
percepts," by necessity ontic psychological, for the cognition of a dynamic world, or
even multi-mundos, as describes it Schrödinger and Von Newman. (1955).
-----------------68 - In support of this suggestion can be focused attention, which can keep the
"conscious perception, which is psychological", to a dynamic world of von Neumann.
(1955-418).
------------69 - For example, conscious awareness (Mindful Awaraness) modulates the activity of
the prefrontal cortex PFC. Established role of this cortical area planning and deliberate
selection at will, of auto-iniciadas by the psychological Agent answers.
---------70.-95- An out notes, there are other memories to long-term bio-molecular networks
inheritable, but we do not know their links with this computer NCC. However, they
are in exchange charge of code (DNA) and the external environment, which can be
suggested that you entanglement quantum-interactions.
-----71 - The operations of these networks are accurate for the fine level of micro
environment, physical macro and its relationship with the code. They must have a
relationship with this issue, are keys for the production of the necessary bio-molecules
to cognition operations and actions. But this issue is not of these notes. (I, De La
Fuentes, 2014, 2015).
-----------72 - The ability of conscious cognition, by implication to the self-regulation of the
emotions, specifically modulates the activity in the critical region of the brain,
Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) with importance for the fields of mental health and the
free will. (Spence and Frith 1999; Schwartz and Begley 2002).

physical laws precise. "In our view, a source of the ubiquitous mind that make up
reality. He adds, that the mind-brain problem is close to being resolved, because these
events indicate that an Agency (consciousness) is producing information, organized
and intelligent, where spacetime emerges. (Comment on Penrose and Hameroff, 2013,

----------79 - A model of human cognitive perception underscores the importance of
representations and cognitive mental simulations from the implicit memory long-term
unconscious and conscious. (Autobiography and Ethos). Even in quantum processes,
there is the "unconscious working memory" or "silent", along with the role of bodysensory-motor-emotional memory, for the process of cognition. (Barsalou. 2007

---80 -95-- Do with which elements of information processes the unconscious? With what
it decides consciousness? These are very important questions. To construct perceptions
and cognitions, unconscious or conscious, has a wide data from the memory of our life
and of the environment, where we live. Phylogeny is inherited in the DNA, and, as we
have seen is passive, and their slow compared to a Psycho-cultural life evolution
human which grows exponentially (Dwight W. Read. 2012. Op. Cited)
---------81 - Geography and culture develop the Psychological ontic of the formation of the
psycho-cultural life that is stored in the autobiography and the ethos, long-term
memory. This data is basic to the unconscious processes of cognition. Consciousness
can only inhibit the delivery of the unconscious calculations.
---------82 - Question: how are these inhibitions of the so-called conscience decisions
taken? From a reflective point of view, they are made with the knowledge, legal, moral
standards and our popular knowledge randomly between good, bad and the
consequences both personal and collective, that are stored in the Ethos and
personality. (Read, Dwight w. 2012. Op. CIT) (Durham, W. H. 1991. Op. CIT) (William
B. Miller, Jr. 2017.) Op. CIT).

---------------83-Interesting question of Immanuel Kant, "... We need to know with what we reason...
"." However, should be more accurate than Kant, and ask: cultural elements should
select for reason, reflection, judge, etc., to make conscious decisions?
--------84 – All this shows the importance of the psycho-culture, and the need to investigate
and analyze culture. For example, in the mathematical sciences, are a series of axioms,
logic, principles, rules, etc., universal, to reason and to carry out the calculations and
decisions. Almost all of this knowledge are knowledge of the scientific community and
the mathematician.
-----------------85 -95- In the ways of thinking and judging, usually the philosophy has played a very
important role since ancient times. It is not strange, that the way of thinking and
decision-making are influences even for her. However, with the advent of other
sciences and contemporary techniques, other theories have been postulated. But many

technical, administrative, aspects of computing among others-oriented. Such solutions
as practices, have been limited to such fields and such purposes of such knowledge.
------------86 - This has typically left decisions of life activities, the popular from day to day and
the early formation of the personality, in the hands of the cultural elements randomly, - which are more than 93% in a life, -- with respect to the of a classroom. These have
many standards morals, are opinions or precepts, and even simple proverbs, etc. So
they are very diverse, through societies, countries, large conglomerates, and, of course
at the individual level. We must not wonder, that we see the most absurd combinations
of results.
-----------------------87 - These moral standards, sometimes called “ethics own”, several particular
purposes, can obey temporary reasons, opinions, and sometimes personal interests. All
this cake comes from the Romans, why the Greek word Ethic it was not understood o /
they concern their own morality, more consonant to their customs and traditions. The
word moral, which accommodated to interests and not as the universal purposes Ethic
was born with them.
------------88. The Ethic of the Greek times, - Aristoteles - the basics should be a Universal Ethica,
in relation to the purpose of the universe and humans. These end of the universe, were
not very easy to meet at that time. Why Aristotle writes your rules-based Ethics. The
very long-term end or Teleological, in dark times, could be confused or being
manipulated by terrestrial gods. No one sought to End of human and biosphere, most
within easy reach.
---------------89. Today, stand out the End of life, humans, the biosphere and their symbionts, which
makes possible a Universal Ethic. However, this must be understood and mentalizing
as a belief that trust, accord and with beneficial results to the Quality of Life, to an
application by consensus. Such a condition once understood, need an education to the
entire population, as an organic whole or holistic.
----------90 -95- The Ethic teaches us to make impartial decisions, with benefits in everyday life,
both personal, human groups, quality of life, equitable life and cooperative, resulting
in efficiency in all activities. A Universal Ethic is needed, now this small world. That
judges trials of consciousness, depend on our opinions temporary and personal,
causing thousands of conflicts, violence and may even lead to war.
---------------91-- All Moral must be within the Universal Ethic, is based on equitable cooperation
and coexistence of groups. From the anthropological, it was begin on set and
development of all human groups, modulates cooperation, the productive efficiency

and the quality of life. Peace needs the Ethic and equity with justice, to prevent
conflicts and violence. (I. Kant. Prolegomena. 1780). (Review of the Judgment and

---- --- ---------------------------92.-95- All scientific experimental data suggests that our reality is acquired by means of
"unconscious cognition", from memory in an "unconscious". Perform actions are made
with the information stored in the psycho-Cultural unconscious or Ethos for the most
part. Consciousness can veto or inhibit, the of the unconscious, which is made with the
previously stored as "Pre-Judge. This not only grasp the realities of every day, but it is
also guide our plans for our lives, quality of life and until the happiness.
-------93 - Some of you are asking: what is the role of DNA or genetic code of our
phylogeny? As we have exposed many times before, all the scientific data of molecular
biology, suggests that their role is passive, limited manufacturing, proteins and
enzymes, according to the requirement of the "cultural and environment
geographical; for adaptation and evolution. There are some heritable memories in
networks of molecules, which interact with DNA environment. Subject is wide and out
of these notes. (De La Fuentes. 2014, 2015. Op. Cit)
-----------------------94 - Details with which our unconscious processes, are mostly of the ontogeny of
development, cultural elements and environment, of their own experiences and
conclusions archived in our memory. If there are other elements out of these
considerations, they should be investigated, clarified, and see the influence on our
quality of life, human health, and the biosphere. (Rivas Mclean. 2008, 2014. Op. cit)
