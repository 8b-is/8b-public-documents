Abstract. We discuss the torsion geometries as the universal dynamical setting for the five-fold symmetry and its
relation to nonorientable surfaces of selfreference embodying a supradual logophysics, rooted in the Möbius strip and
Klein Bottle. We frame the discussion in terms of image-schemas in cognitive semantics and their disruption stemming
from supraduality and nonorientability. We present the relation with anholonomic phases, chaos and the brain-mind as
an integrated dynamical system. We discuss nonorientability as the characteristic transcendental metapattern of resonant
connection, pattern formation and recognition. We present the torsion geometry and nonorientability in psychophysics
and the neurosciences. We discuss the homology of the torsion geometry of physical space or spacetime with that of the
unconscious modelization by the brain-mind of the kinematics of objects in physical space and in the perception of
music, elaborating on the Principle of Complementarity of cognitive psychology due to Shepard. We elaborate on the
phenomenological construal of experience, the world as experience. We discuss the supraduality of the liminal states of
consciousness and the basis of awareness in memory. We introduce the cognitive psychology foundations of memory
on nonorientability and its relations to the short-memory space and its quantumlike nature, and the hyperbolicity of the
psychophysics of vision. We discuss the chaotic behaviour of dynamical systems as a manifestation of supraduality as
their nonorientability. We propose a basis for the source of consciousness, the Hard Problem, given by the principles of
selfreference and hetero-reference which generate the Klein Bottle supradual logophysics. We present the supradual
logophysics of neuron cytoskeletal structures, its relation to torsion, resonances, topological and geometrical phases and
the microtubule dynamics in terms of nonlinear buckling patterns and nonorientability, and still the torsion geometry of
the irreversible thermodynamical processes supporting interactions-at-a-distance. We discuss the primal relation of
torsion, nonorientability and memory, particularly arising in the buckling of microtubules. We discuss the primal
morphogenesis of the cell as a tensegrity structure, torsion and the indiscernibility of elastodynamics, electromagnetic
and gravitational wavefronts as morphogenetic fields. We discuss nonorientability as the metaform pattern of connection
and resonance, particularly of interaction-at-a-distance. We apply it to a topological allosteric effect mediated by
electromagnetic fields. We discuss the topological chemistry paradigm, particularly of organic chemistry where
conformation superposition is crucial, its relation to anaesthetics and its application to the ORC OR theory of Penrose
and Hameroff for consciousness as arising from the collapse of the wave function which we relate to the
multiconformation in the topological chemistry paradigm.We propose a model of continuous signal processing in digital
terms which allows an optimal reconstruction -from digital to continuous- in terms of the Nyquist-Shannon theorem
whose constraints on frequencies and bandwidths is naturally interpreted in the terms of the 2:1 harmonics of
nonorientability in the Möbius strip or Klein Bottle. We discuss the non-dual logic of the tubulin code and the resonator
nature of the neuronal cytoskeleton. We propose that the topological phases appearing in the cytoskeleton may
correspond to the topological anholonomity, namely, nonorientability, as was elicited empirically by the Bandyopadhyay
group, the existence of anholonomity corresponding to the 360° rotation characteristic of the topological anholonomity,
Möbius strip. We propose the Matrix Logic representation of the Klein Bottle logic as the basis for microtubule
computations, and discuss the relation to quantum computation, topological entanglement and the topological
coherence/decoherence Klein Bottle cycle. We also relate it to holography, the brain’s integration and Velmans’
Reflexive Monism extended by Rapoport. We discuss the multiconformation orientable and nonorientable resonators
electronic devices and antennas as classical-quantum realisations of microtubule coherent behaviour. We discuss the
relation of life and consciousness and the topological nonorientable embodiment of memory. We introduce the
dynamical reduction program for the collapse of the quantum state in terms of the torsion stochastic differential geometry
of the quantum geometry of Quantum Mechanics as projective space, and particularly the stochastic extension of the
Schroedinger equation to account for the coupling of quantum system and environment, say a measurement apparatus.

Thus we identify a realisation of the dynamical reduction program which is based on the torsion geometry, yet supports
an agent-free collapse of the quantum state, as an objective albeit random process due to quantum fluctuations. We shall
discuss the present supradual logophysics in several aspects such as 1) microtubule structure and dynamics, 2) the
orientable and nonorientable conformations of organic molecules, 3) the relation with anaesthetics and the altered states
of consciousness and 4) confront them with the tenets of Penrose & Hameroff ORC OR theory for the origin of
consciousness, not only the topological chemistry but their choice of a superposition of null torsion as in General
Relativity, which renders a trivial selfreferentiality, with the topological chemistry multiconformations which requires
non-null torsion. The nontrivial selfreferentiality is both proper to the mind and the torsion geometry, be that on the
physical, chemical, perceptual or cognitive domains. All in all, we propose that consciousness is neither based on
panpsychism nor the collapse of quantum states, nor exclusively on the control of superposition of conformations of
organic chemistry, but rather on the torsion-nonorientable geometry-topology based on the principles of selfreference
and hetero-reference, operating in all domains: that of meaning,the mental-anatomical-physiological domain, structural
processes of matter energy and in-formation, be that physical, chemical, biological, cognitive and perception. We present
a remarkable connection between them. Our approach rather than multidisciplinary will be transdisciplinary, a
possibility supported on supraduality - transcending the dual-logic based logophysics- from which the theory will follow
in a rather smooth way.

1. Introduction

Given the universality of the Golden Mean it is quite remarkable that its association with the
universal dynamical geometries of nonlinear vortical morphology, namely the torsion
geometries, is unacknowledged. This is still quite remarkable given that one of the most basic
example of torsion geometries is none other than the Lie groups of continuous symmetries
which sustains much of theoretical physics, originally introduced by Sophus Lie to give a
structural support for perception (Pribram [196]).These geometries are basic to physics,
cosmology, biology, chemistry, perception, cognition, music, anatomy-physiology,
phenomenology as the world as created/experienced – rather than conceived as given data.
These geometries introduce morphogenesis as well as pattern formation and pattern recognition
through their vortical nonlinearity. We remark, pattern formation operates on Nature at large,
particularly the brain-mind, while pattern recognition is proper to the latter. The Klein Bottle
being the metaform for both (Rapoport,[228,231-234,236], Carlsson [31,32]), it is natural to
conceive vortical motions as the dynamical metaform of Nature associated to the Golden Mean
and the Fibonacci series, as shown by John Bell Pettigrew in Design in Nature, published in
1907 [18]. Actually, D’Arcy Thompson Wentworth, considered the father of mathematical
biology was mentored by Bell Pettigrew. Although he curated his collection and succeeded him
at St Andrews, he failed to acknowledge the primality of vortices but partially and almost
entirely he did so with Bell Pettigrew’s contribution to his own work [13]. The fact that torsion
geometry is tied to the pentagon allows to elicit another remarkable extensions of the 5-fold
symmetry. Indeed, already in the Principle of Complementarity in cognitive psychology
(Shepard [250-253]), torsion supports the association of cognition, torsion and nonorientable
topology, as crucial to the ongoing mental formation of models of the kinematics of extended
objects (Rapoport [236]). Nonorientability as in the surfaces of selfreference, Möbius strip,
Klein Bottles, not only support this modeling, but are also basic to embody memorization,
mental and physiological modeling of visual and somatosensory experience (Rapoport
[222,226,228,229,231-236]). The defining characteristic one-sidedness of nonorientable
surfaces supports the integration of Outside and Inside. Thus they transcend the duality inherent
to Aristotelian-Boolean logic [230-236]. Another surface of selfreference, yet orientable, the
2d-torus, provides a banal selfreference and a topology for dualism (Rapoport [235]). Thus
these nonorientable surfaces embody the disposition for cognitive capabilities by providing the
metaforms –mother-form or form of forms- of a supradual logophysics which further supports
a transdisciplinary unification of the material world of matter and energy, information, the
psyche, as well as the imaginal domain and that of sign processes (Rapoport [236]) associated

to cognition as meaning. Returning to torsion as the topological shape instrumental for
embodying memorization, the Golden Mean appears coding brain harmonics as the quantum of
thought associated with short-memory span (see Weiss &Weiss [280]) related to the
quantization of subjective visual space, to be discussed below.
The first purpose of this article is to briefly present the pentagonal torsion geometries and
its association to nonorientability and the anholonomic geometro-topological phases pervasive
to physics, to set a more comprehensive bearing for the 5-fold symmetry. Remarkably, this
realises Felix Klein’s Erlangen program (see Sharpe & Chern [111]) and unseparably the
gestaltic modeling construal of the world as experience, to which we shall also refer in this
setting. Furthermore, it is a geometry of chance prophesied by Pascal, which considers
Brownian motion as a geometry with continuous nondifferentiable paths with a stochastic
character, Stochastic Differential Geometry (Elworthy [47], Ikeda & Watanabe, [89], Rapoport
[201,206,209]), developed in theoretical physics (Rapoport [200-210, 216-221,227]) and fluiddynamics (Rapoport [201-217]). In particular this was elaborated by Rapoport for the
Schroedinger equation on space or spacetime as torsion geometries associated to Brownian
motion, or the Schroedinger equation for open -i.e.non-isolated- systems, say subjected to
measurements, evolving in the so-called quantum geometry of complex projective space
[218,219]. Both the linear and nonlinear Schroedinger equations reveal the underlying torsion
geometry and its relations to Brownian motion. Moreover, this is revealed as well in the linear
and nonlinear Dirac-Hestenes for spinor-operator fields of Relativistic Quantum Mechanics,
and its equivalence to the Maxwell equation, in the setting of Clifford bundles (Rapoport
[207,208,217]). In Stochastic Differential Geometry the torsion field describes the average
velocity while the Brownian fluctuations describing the fluctuations are related to a diffusion
matrix related to a square-root form of a metric which can be positive definite [201,203,206
]or non-positive definite as in Einstein’s Relativity theory, or Minkowski space ( Oron &
Horwitz [180]). Here the Fokker-Planck operator of the diffusion process is the Laplacian
operator of a Riemann-Cartan-Weyl covariant derivative, with trace-torsion (Rapoport [201]).
The notion of a non-differentiable structure of spacetime at Planck scale as the geometry of
quantum fluctuations and its relevance to the measurement problem of Quantum Mechanics has
become the physical basis for developing schemes for the so called collapse of the wavefunction
and its role as a form of “quantum gravity” related to the alleged emergence of consciousness
as in (Penrose & Hameroff [74,75,192]). Remarkably enough, rather than torsion what is
considered is the derivative curvature field, which at Planck scale would grow rather than a flat
structure being the case (Percival [188]). However, independently of these considerations of a
Stochastic Differential Geometry as the geometry of fluctuations, ‘t Hooft has shown [87] that
the singularities of a “quantum foam” have for event horizon a Möbius strip arising from the
antipodal identification of projective space, as described by Rapoport, which is the case of
visual perception and the arousal of the sense of selfhood, selfconsciousness (Rapoport [236]).
With respect to philosophy in relation to which science has mostly developed as
unrelateable forms of cognition and of probing the world and phenomena at large [230] the
supradual Klein bottle logophysics and their interweaving by ‘gluing’ several Klein Bottles,
namely HyperKlein Bottles as forms of multi-distinctions proper to complexity ([230,236]),
realise Heidegger’s claim (see Malpas [155]) that phenomenology is topologically grounded
(see Rapoport[230,236]; Rosen [241]). It provides for a transdisciplinarian unification of
science [223], knowledge systems at large, music (Mazzola [159], Tymozcko [274], Payeron
[185]) and its cognition (Merrick,[320]).
As second -yet the major- topic of this article, we shall make the case of the
transdisciplinarian unification of science in terms of this supradual logophysics, extending and

applying the previous discussion to develop a novel paradigm for the neurosciences and
consciousness, based on the principles of selfreference and hetero-reference proper to the
foundations of torsion geometry and nonorientability, and to cognition.
2. Nonorientability and torsion geometries: the 5-fold symmetry

Figure 1 (Möbius strip; left figure from Rapoport, [228] CC):The green line is a centre line. Suppose
the red line extends counterclockwise from point to turn back and arrives at point b which is the opposite
side of point, so to return to b again another complete 360° turn is required. The same is the case of the
red line which extends one more round, thus gets back to the starting point a. The red line never went
across the centre line. Nevertheless the red line runs both sides of the centre line. CC
Another way of expressing this is what is above the centre line turns to become below, and the
converse as well: Top and Bottom are continuously intertransformable. Top and Bottom are the elements
of one of the most basic universal image-schemas -as conceived in cognitive linguistics after Johnson
and Lakoff [96,139]. While dualism in an orientable surface assigns to this image-schema a fixed dual
categorization, the nonorientabiity of the surface belies their dual character. Indeed, the red line looks
like parallel lines when we see them partially. But it is not true. Route A and route B are actually a single
route. This belies the top/down duality. Maurits Cornelis Escher represented this supraduality with his
famous Ascending and Descending litograph. The green line looks a median or a central reservation on
a road, a safe place from collision with whatever transits outside of it. However, it does not divide
Möbius strip into two: thus the supraduality just expressed; or non-duality, would we stick to the habit
of dualism as primal. Together with this, what we may describe as whatever is placed inside turns to be
placed outside, and the converse. So another universal image-schema which is construed as a dual
categorical divide is also belied. This is another manifestation of the supradual nature of Möbius strip.
Philosophers Wittgenstein and Bachelard contested the dual Inside/Outside categorization., usually
phrased as the CONTAIN image-schema (see Wittgenstein, IV 35, 4023 [282], Bachelard [9]). The
notion developed in cognitive linguistics is that our thoughts, our conceptualization and theoretizations
at large, are anchored in figures of speech denoting a spatial disposition, and these image-schemas -as
they are called- are cross-culture universals. CONTAIN -and dualism, at large- is paradoxically both
eminent and transparent in our construal of the representation of the world as already manifest in
language, actually hegemonic based on the dual onto-epistemology, after Aristotelian-Boolean logic. In
system theory, CONTAIN introduces a divide of form and content. In mathematics set theory this imageschema established its formalization which were further applied to attempt the axiomatical formalization
of mathematics as a whole, the program faltered, proved unrealizable. It is problematic indeed, to
consider any language as if exterior to its context -understood literally, a complex of physical, biological,
cognitive, psychological, social, or economic conditions-, producing at times unresolvable paradoxes as
Russell’s invocation of an infinite set that contains itself. CONTAIN is indeed a very important imageschema, transcendental in establishing the dual onto-epistemology, i.e. based on Aristotelian logic. Its
fundamental laws or principles are the principle of identity, the principle of non-contradiction and the
principle of no third value, tertium non datur -but true and false, for its two possible values. We shall

this discuss further with respect to Quantum Cognition, the biophysics of action potentials and to chaotic
systems.
CONTAIN pertains either to the real space where we suffer on kicking a stone, the abstract space of
the mathematician and physicist, and the imaginal space of a prophet, poet, shaman or dreamer. Whereas
the latter two may experience as if real that Inside and Outside are connected, this is unlikely to the
previous formalizing subjects. This is a privilege which on delivery to this world from the maternal
womb every newborn experiences, with no due need of immediate reflection about the transformation.
However, the fecunded ovum starting from a cleavage on its surface, turns outside-in, the blastopore
invagination as a first step of development towards the maturation of a viviparous organism. As a stage
of this inward flexing and folding development of a morphomechanics of tissue surfaces, the exterior
surface of the ovum turns outside-in migrating to constitute the nervous system which the later outgoing
brain finalises turns outwards to become the eyes, the progeny of a turning Outside-Inside-Outside
development. Invertebrate Hydra makes of its -in principle – eternal being this perpetual transformation.
Most of the matter in the Universe is produced by supernovae remnants of collapsing stars. Cassiopeia
A for one such star turned Outside-Inside ([232]). CONTAIN image-schema and the cosmologies
constructed on its terms appear banal in terms of such transformations. An ideally elastic 2-sphere might
be turned inside-out with no discontinuities nor creases to produce another 2-sphere with the previous
Inside and Outside interchanged, through mediating nonorientable surfaces such as the Klein Bottle or
Morin’s surface (Smale’s Paradox [4,158,230]). In distinction with the ideally elastic 2sphere, the ovum
requires a discontinuity [230,231]. We are to more surprises:
If we cut the Möbius strip along the green line, its length becomes doubled. It plays a crucial role in
the process of duplication and transcription of DNA (Rapoport [233]).There is no opposite lane on
Möbius strip. This is the topological origin of the 2:1 harmonic. It is also the origin of a protoform of
Newton’s Third Law, albeit it does not require, in distinction with Newton’s formulation, a dualistic
assumption, nor the instantaneous causality that this law implicitly assumes; causality, if any, is
embodied by the 2:1 resonance produced by the 180º twist. Indeed, consider a normal (i.e. perpendicular)
vector to Möbius strip; if we move it along any curve in a 360° turn as before, we would find it pointing
in the opposite turn will return the vector to the samepoint further coinciding with its original
configuration. Rather than having an action and a reaction as distinct, in the Möbius strip and Klein
Bottle, the opposite and equal modulus of normal vectors is a resultant of the 2:1 harmonic produced by
the nonorientable torsion, not an hypothesis for the foundations of physics at large. Thus it appears that
this harmonic is more fundamental to physics than Newton’s Third Law. Also, this is the case of the
origin of the 4π symmetry of relativistic quantum mechanics (Rapoport [228]). The Möbius strip is a
topological (Berry)-phase (an)holonomy. We shall return to this below.Would we cut and unfold the
Möbius strip while keeping the length of the edge with notches, it turns into a trapezoid and the length
and slope of the notches lines are distorted; see figure 4. This distortion is of great physical import.
Indeed, while the fundamental rule of the sum of vectors, say forces, on Euclidean space is valid in the
case of the parallelogram, in the case of Möbius strip unfolded i.e. the trapezoid, this is no longer the
case. In fact, this property is shared by spaces with torsion, in which parallelograms don’t close so that
the sum of two vectors does not yield the diagonal which is ill-defined. Thus, instead in the non-closure
of the parallelogram formed by the vectors uP and vP at P and their parallel transport, uR at R and vQ
at Q, a fifth side T(u,v) closes the infinitesimal vectors. Prolonging T(u,v) to the line joining P and Q,
we have the trapezoid whose completion is depicted in red, the inferior triangle at the right. Would we
start with uP and vP of equal length then we can form a regular pentagon by scaling T(u,v) by a factor
of the lengths of uP (or vP ), |v𝑃 |, and as |vP |T(u, v)/|T(u,v)| whose length coincides with theirs. (For the
latter normalization a metric compatible with the parallel transport is required (Rapoport [201]).Thus
the regular pentagon, i.e. all sides of equal length- is formed by considering torsion and defining parallel
translation in terms of it, and further a metric as described. An example of this was introduced by the
geometrization of dislocations of crystals by Kondo at the 1940s. In dislocation theory the torsion is
called the Burgers vector, and as it will turn out, is a geometrical anholonomy.

The infinitesimal parallelogram of
vectors drawn in black does not close,
the torsion being the fifth side closing
the otherwise open parallelogram. We
prolong it to draw the inferior rhs
triangle in red and thus the trapezoid
cnaturally introduced by torsion.

Figure 2 (From Rapoport [228] CC):The five-fold symmetry of torsion geometry. Notice that the
torsion can be introduced with either chirality, clockwise or anticlockwise¸ which introduces a minus
sign to distinguish them. As a torsion tensor or differential 2-form this makes of them noncommutative,
specifically anticommutative: on transposing the covariant indices of the torsion tensor or as vectorvalued differential form of degree 2, a minus sign is introduced . Noncommutation, say as in the product
of matrices, is the crucial property which supports Quantum Mechanics, and is key to Quantum
Cognition, the application of the mathematical formalism to model cognitive processes such as
information decision process, concepts and conceptual reasoning, human judgment, and perception,
cognition in general [2,29,37,38,100,101]. This arises from the contextuality of Quantum Mechanics as
a theory of physics and of cognitive processes. The Klein Bottle is a body of contextuality, to be
introduced below.

.

Figure 3 (From [228] CC): We introduce torsion by shear in a lattice; in the rhs by a caterpillar moving
in the surface of a perfect crystal. In the lhs we have a perfect lattice, as is the case of a discrete spacetime rendering of the homogeneous spacetime of General Relativity, but in the central area in which a
dislocation is the case. We see then the transition from parallelograms that close (null torsion as in
General Relativity), to non-closing and the formation of a fifth side, the torsion field. The figure above
shows the meaning of torsion. In an otherwise perfect crystal (whose vertices are described in red), i.e.
free of inhomogeneities an edge dislocation is produced. This is done either by removal (i.e.,
introduction of singularities) of atoms of the crystal, as the figure shows, or by introducing extra
material; both are inhomogeneities. Torsion can be introduced by shear (i.e., the relative motion of two
planes) as figure 3 shows, on the plane itself. (The other class of dislocations are the screw dislocations
involving a shear on the direction transversal to the plane, which acting together with a shear dislocation
we get the figure of DNA). Think of a caterpillar which moves a lattice a step at a time, and the shear
produces the torsion of the crystal; this shear produces a vortical motion on the vertical plane to the
shearing plane under the mixing of layers for small that it can be. Another analogy is that of a rug, which
moving in the perfect background of the homogeneous crystal; local changes affect the whole structure;
the analogy strikingly applies to the crease (the folded rug) formation in the gastropore invagination in
Embryology (Rapoport, 2011c, 2014,2016a,b). It can also be produced by a hole in the surface,
producing an embryological expansion wave. Thus, it is an action-dependent participative geometry
introduced in terms of inhomogeneities by the subject, say the caterpillar, or more basically the photon.

This stands in stark contrast with the homogeneous situation of a Cartesian ideal geometry exterior to
the subject, which corresponds in the continuum limit in which the atoms of the crystal approach
indefinitively, i.e. the continuum hypothesis of Einstein, which due to the lack of a singularity, it
corresponds to the zero torsion metric-based geometry of General Relativity (Cartan [33],Rapoport &
Sternberg [200,204];Hehl et.al. [81-83], Vargas [276]). In short, to have loci, a geometrical reference at
all and in the first place – quite literally! -self-referentially dislocations are needed: These are the
inhomogeneities that put up a geometrical locus. The most basic dislocation is produced by a photon, a
quantum particle, a singularity of an electromagnetic field, or still, a low dimensional submanifold of
the wavefront eikonal propagation of light rays (Rapoport [220,221]); no duality of wave and particle.
They play an important role not only as topological anholonomities to be discussed below but as a kind
of square root of the null state (the “mind Apeiron”, or vacuum state of the mind) in Matrix Logic as
Penrose twistors [220,221,223] The parallelograms where inhomogeneities are present do not
close,while in the perfect crystal they do close indicating a self-referential trivial loop: by default is
indeed a loop, i.e. closed without mediations. This is also the case of the metric-derived spacetime
geometry of General Relativity. Instead, in the former case a pentagon is produced. The fifth newborn
side at the upper right side of the centre, joining Q’ with b, is the torsion –the self-referential mediator;
it is necessary and sufficient to the effect of completing the self-referential closure of the otherwise
closed parallelogram; we shall explain this further below. As the figure 4 shows in the centre, the torsion
appears producing a trapezoid with vertices P, Q, P’ and Q’, since the upper side is now longer than the
lower one. Yet trapezoids are themselves Möbius strips cut transversally, say along the line on the
Möbius strip below joining P (P’) and Q (Q’) below, and laid open on a plane, which by identifying the
opposite lateral sides PP’, QQ’, on a previously 180º twist of the trapezoid, re-establishes thus the
Möbius strip, as shown below:

(Rapoport [224,234]), as introduced in terms of non-dual de Morgan logic by Kauffman ([112]). They
express the imaginary logic values proposed by Spencer-Brown in his calculus of indications [303] as
reentrant states of the primal distinction: torsion. These time waves are crucial to Cantor’s diagonal
construction for his argument of a continuum, which due to his unacknowledged choice of Boolean logic
he was unaware of.They underly the paradoxical unending tail of the dyadic expansion of most real
numbers (Hellerstein, [304], [226,231]); for an update on these issues see (Kauffman et.al. [131] )
From the KBL appears the genetic code with its 64 elementary codons, and furthermore the genome
and its association to the Dirac algebra of Quantum Mechanics. The latter is also based on the KBL
reinterpretation of the recursive Universal Rewrite System (NURS) of Rowlands [243] . Since NURS
topologically is based on the Klein Bottle sustaining a coupling of a fermion singularity with the rest of
the universe as its dual element, this coupling evokes a boson interaction of the fermion with the universe
for its dual. Indeed, in NURS bosons of spin 0 and spin 1 can be produced by fermion-antifermion
combinations while boson condensates can be formed in terms of fermion-fermion combinations. In
other words, the Klein Bottle with its 2:1 harmonics supports fermions and bosons. We shall return to
this upon discussing the cytoskeletal neuron architecture and action potentials.

Möbius strip although it surmounts the dualism of CONTAIN it is still embedded in Euclidean 3d
space, as contained in it. The Klein Bottle is entirely different: rather than contained in what seems
ambient space, it is selfcontained through the selfpenetration. Thus we see that dualism as supported by
CONTAIN is inappropriate to theoretization vis-à-vis this selfpenetrating surface. However, in practical
terms the Klein Bottle can be construed in ambient 3d space by using liquid crystals further solidified
as exposed at the London Museum of Science, in the crystal figures by artist-extraordinaire Alan
Bennett, HyperKlein Bottles.The latter introduce image-schemas which transcends hierarchy through
heterarchies, functional organisations which disrupt the iterated nesting of CONTAIN as in the
Babushkas Russian dolls [230,236].
Klein Bottle can be represented in 4d or 5d removing its selfpenetration, thus serving as the
metaform for both pattern recognition and pattern formation (Carlsson), which is basic to the patterns
of the brain-mind formed by eigenstates harmonics of the brain connectome (Atasoy et.al. [8], Rapoport
& Perez [234], Rapoport [236])
Notably, the most basic example of a manifold which bears a torsion geometry is a Lie group of
continuous symmetries! The so-called structural coefficients which describe the operations of
infinitesimal symmetries, the Lie Algebra, stand for the components of the torsion tensor ([232]). It
seems that conceptual astraying from the geometry of Lie symmetries which lay at the very basis of
theoretical physics, in particular since the inception of gauge theories, has produced a cognitive
dissonance that made of metrics, i.e., distances, as the basic structure of the geometrization of physics
after Einstein, rather than symmetries. A Poincaré group gauge theory of gravitation with torsion and
spin was somewhat exceptional (Goenner [67], Hehl et.al. [81-83]). So, given that symmetries provide
the basic geometry of physics, as well as chemistry, which also is the case of biology, in addition of
vortices as the dynamical form of torsion, we are led to examine what are the inherent symmetries of
the Möbius strip and the Klein Bottle. While elementary dual image-schemas CONTAIN and ON - the
latter as in the expression “on the table” pointing to above/below categorization- are surmounted by the
Möbius strip and Klein Bottle, the left/right categorization in terms of specular symmetry is also
compromised by considering chirality as in enantiomeric pairs. Handedness is no longer global. This is
of crucial importance to chemistry and biology, as discovered by Pasteur, which we shall refer to
(Rapoport [228]) for further graphical information.
3. The induction of selforganisation and nonorientability
The topological entanglement supported by nonorientabiity is crucial to the overall coherence of
genomes, in which separate genomic configurations are interlinked in time and in space, establishes a
coherence in time and in space as a form of non-Darwinian evolution linked to palindromic sections.
This operates through resonant harmonics given by the proportions of codons to mirror-codons, which

is almost perfectly equal to one, and to the proportion of the 32 most frequent codon-mirror codons pairs
to the 32 less frequent pairs -discovered by Perez [113], which is 2 to 1; both being the signature of nonorientability (Rapoport [224,233]). The Golden Mean plays a crucial role in genomes and in harmonic
principles at large, for the material world, cognition and its experience, the phenomenology of music
[320]. Genomes are liquid crystals, omnipresent in biological systems, in which nonorientability is
crucial to their coherence (Bouligand [24,25]).
The remarkable fact is that the topology of liquid crystals is amenable to control, and to the induction
of topological changes. These can be produced by the expedience of introducing into them colloidal
particles; thus topological changes arise due to the incompatibility of constraints, namely the anchoring
conditions on the particle surfaces with the alignment imposed by the cell boundaries, or at large
distances (Machon and Alexander [153,154]; Melle [164]; Musevic [171]). So, forms which are
pervasive to organic chemistry such as knotted defects, Möbius strips and molecular motors, can be
induced. This amounts to a general principle of nature for the topological generation of complexity as
intricate structures in which nonorientable surfaces act as a kind of “glueˮ, simply by inducing them
through emplacing colloidal particles on cholesteric or in nematic liquid crystals, such as DNA (Chow
[36]). The sole factor appears to be the nonorientable topology of the director field of the crystal, which
underlies the formation of these intricate structures in terms of topological dislocations (generically,
torsion geometries). It operates through the elastical adaptation of the director field to the extraneous
colloidal particles, as in the previous references. But rather than the non-orientable topology being
erased, more intricate robust structures appear to be the case, still carrying as their progeny, the
nonorientable structure which make them possible. Thus, complexity –as intricate structures progenies
of foldedness, though no genomes are involved- appears to be related to non-orientability and its elastic
deformation to ensure its preservation under disturbances!
The addition of particles as inductors of orders can be interpreted in very general terms as the
introduction to asymmetry to a system which otherwise already has an ordered structure producing
constraints to those which may already be acting. The existence and relevance of constraints in any
form, which usually appear as boundary conditions, are crucial to selforganisation and life [231,232].
4. Berry topological phases, (an)holonomities, torsion and nonorientability
The paradigm of theoretical physics as spacetime or state-space geometries (say, the projective Hilbert
space of quantum mechanics), which in General Relativity was predicated in terms of homogeneity and
geodesic motion, the latter as an extension of linear free fall motion, is clearly invalid vis-à-vis the
omnipresence of vortical nonlinear motion in Nature. First of all, vortices are indissociable from
singularities which stand as organising centres. Furthermore, the rotational motion establishes cyclicity
which is selfreferential and yet hetero-referential since the cyclical motion also refers to the centre. So
we have two principles which support vortical inhomogeneities: Namely selfreference and heteroreference, to be discussed below. They are basic to cognition and awareness, and to perception in the
first place as the pinwheel hypercolumn structure of the primary visual cortex. Thus, in the primal stage
of processing the visual system has for functional topology the Klein Bottle (Swindale [266] Tanaka
[268, 269]). Furthermore the primary visual cortex arises from selforganisation as a π-periodic structure
(Miller [128]) which we related to the above hypercolumnar Klein Bottle functional architecture
([234,236]) and was independently interpreted as produced by a Berry quantum phase (Marcer &
Rowlands [156]): The Klein Bottle as the topological anholonomity given by gluing two opposite
chirality Möbius strips already mentioned [228]. Secondly, vortices cannot be identified as objects
occupying space or space-time, say as in classical physics or General Relativity; vortices are geometries,
dynamic as such. Furthermore they are eminently relational and processual, and they do not produce a
space or spacetime as a container with absolute “Inside” and “Outside “ categories. Instead these are
connected dynamically, at times the differences, if any, are blurred or undefinable, uncertain:
generically, vortices mix Insides and Outsides. Yet the geometry of inhomogeneity which embodies
vortices is that of torsion, and ultimately at the Planck scale level, associated to quantum spin (Ross
[244]), with spin-density for the macroscopic source of torsion in the extended theory of gravitation
(Hehl et.al. [81-83]). Torsion stands as the fundamental geometry of physics, for which cyclical

processes are the most fundamental (Dolce [45]). Particularly torsion geometry is the case of i) quantum
physics (Rapoport, as already indicated), ii) the fundamental interactions as spacetime symmetries rather
than internal symmetries (Rapoport &Tilli [202]), iii) fluid and magneto-hydrodynamics -the most
pervasive form of matter in the cosmos, iv) biology (Rapoport, [224,225,229,230, 232-236,238]), v) the
topological chemistry paradigm, vi) in the Klein Bottle form of the Mendeleev Periodic Table of
Elements which is the unfoldment of the Golden spiral as a standing wave (Boeyens & Lavendis [22]),
vii) perception and cognition [213,220,223], and viii) crucial to music and its experience
[159,251,274]. Torsion geometry is the case of fluids as the paramount matter organisations of the
cosmos at all scales, particularly liquid crystals. The latter have nonorientable topologies pervasive to
biology [225, 231,232], genomes (Rapoport, [233]), cholesterics and nematics (Machon [153,154)], and
coherent water domain crucial to cell metabolism (Ling [135], Rapoport [225]). They are also crucial
to the topological chemistry paradigm (Mezey [118], Flapan [51], Bonchev 136, Sokolov [258]) , and
to the topological entanglement of molecules having multiple conformations (Putz & Ori [197])
We have already introduced geometrical torsion as the natural geometry of nonorientability, yet we
wish to examine this in a different guise: As a primal form of “panpsychism”, more properly of
pansemiosis -the world constituted by signs processes eliciting meaning-, which is proper to the
supradual logophysics through the action of referral to. However, where the psyche, if any, though
unnecessary in general, is related to selfreference and hetero-reference, as already discussed. Indeed, it
appears as the completion of a space or spacetime dislocation which closes a fractured cycle taken
around a singularity, thus blending selfreference (to produce the closure of the path around a singularity)
and hetero-reference (as the alter of the singularity). Selfreference and hetero-reference are the two
fundamental cognitive principles, however present as a vortical process of geometrical comparison
which Nature itself produces. Alternatively it appears from cutting open non-transversally the Möbius
strip to render either the trapezoid as the crystal relaxed description of the homogenized dislocated
parallelogram or the pentagon, described in the figures 2 and 3 above (see Batterman [16], Figs. 3 & 4
where it is identified as an anholonomy). Thus we can identify torsion as the primal geometrical
anholonomy to be discussed below.
The name anholonomy is a major source of confusion since some authors call it as holonomy. In
theories of gravitation torsion is related to the so called anholonomic nonintegrable systems of reference,
and coherently with this in the realm of theoretical physics at large,it has been called anholonomy. The
term has been derived from classical mechanics, The terms ‘‘holonomy’’ and ‘‘anholonomy’’ derive
from the classical mechanics of systems evolving under certain constraints. If the constraint is
integrable, i.e. the evolution of the system does not depend on the particular path, and leads to a
reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, it is called ‘‘holonomic.’’ Nonintegrable constraints, i.e.
path dependent motions, are called‘‘anholonomic’’ or ‘‘nonholonomic” an in gravitation or quantum
physics. Geometers apparently do not respect this distinction calling anholonomies ‘‘holonomies.’’
Berry took this reversal of usage to be ‘‘a barbarism” [288,289]. The name anholonomy as called by the
physicists which have mostly remained. They are also called alternatively quantum phases, geometric
phases or Berry phases. He discovered that in the cyclic trajectories in the quantum state-geometry given
by projective Hilbert space adding to it a circular U(1)-phase symmetry , antipodal quantum states carry
a phase. This phase is elicited upon completion of the cylic path in which an initial state is transported
by a rule of parallel transport, the torsion appearing as the end result. Due to its its rendering of an
understanding of seemingly disparate phenomenon in terms of a unifying concept, the discovery of
Berry’s phase is considered fundamental to physics (Lyre [152]). More of this below.
A cursory definition of anholonomy is as follows. We transport a system on a selfreferential– i.e.,
closed –path in the abstract space of states of a system to further discover the fact that the state variables
return to their initial values ,and that there is no local rate of change for quantity S. However, it appears
there is a global change in S’s value at the end of the closed path in the complete system of states. Thus,
in manifest physical appearance there is a difference with the initial state on returning to it through a
closed loop in state-space. This final state is called the anholonomity. Two observations are in order.
Firstly is that the notion of transport is more precisely of parallel transport acting on what is being
transported, say a state of a system or a vector in spacetime say a crystal. It is a relational construct.The
path upon which the parallel transport can be differentiable or continuous non-differentiable. The latter

is the case of Stochastic Differential Geometry, the torsion geometry of Brownian motion already
introduced, elaborating on Edward Nelson’s conception of the Schroedinger equation arising from
random fluctuations of the vacuum and Newton’s second law with acceleration derived from the mean
velocity of the random motions [175], the torsion drift vectorfield [201,206,208-211]. The notion of
parallel transport in the setting of torsion geometries was introduced by Elie Cartan. It is called a Cartan
or affine connection [33]. Its centrality is apparent in being the core instrument in theoretical physics in
the modern extension of Klein’s Erlangen Program (Sharpe & Chern [111]). It further extends to the
psyche through the Principle of Complementarity of Shepard ([250-253]): Namely the unconscious
modeling of the mind by introjection of the physical world in terms of representations which are further
conditioned by embodied constraints [236]. Secondly a cyclic character about which the transport is
carried out, as in the case of torsion and nonorientability. Thirdly, the ultimate cognitive operation is of
establishing a difference and furthermore, second-order differences arising from the primal one
(Johansen [294]). In other words, the primal perception and principle for creation, in the first place, is
the perception of a distinction, a difference, its metaform the Klein Bottle Second-order differences
allow for the eliciting of meaning and understanding, as proposed by cybernetist Gregory Bateson.
Let us identify primal forms of geometric-topological anholonomities in the very structure of the
supradual Klein Bottle logophysics. Indeed, the primal topological anholonomy is embodied as the 2:1
harmonics of the Möbius strip and Klein Bottle decurring from their nonorientability. We recall Fig.1:
When we take a vector normal to the surface at some point of a Möbius strip points upwards (action)
and we further transport longitudinally this vector to the same point placed on the “other” side after a
360° percourse completing thus half a closed path, the normal vector now points downwards (reaction).
Another way of understanding the anholonomity of the Möbius strip is as follows. Given a point on the
vortex as centre of coordinates would we consider the radius vector from the centre to the point on the
surface, then after a complete 360° rotation the radius returns to the same point but the normal vector
does not, thus the anholonomity of 360° degrees of the Möbius strip. Another complete turn of 360°
will complete the path to close it and yield the same upper-pointing vector. Möbius strip is the case of
a topological anholonomity, and is founded on non-abstract-physical space terms, not a state-space,
which nevertheless is the case. Actually, this state-space is given by Möbius strip and the normal vectors
to it, and the parameter space is subsumed by two values, +1 and -1. They describe the upper-pointing
and downward-pointing direction of
normal vectors. Thus the nonorientability allows for a
characterization either as a “real”-space or state-space anholonomity, somewhat of a Platonian
archetype which very much manifests as real. The latter issue of the abstract or real character of
anholonomities is a subject of discussion (Lyre [152]; Bliokh et.al. [21]).
As for the space or spacetime anholonomity we have already identified the torsion, say of a
dislocated crystal, a viscous fluid or a quantum system, the latter being the velocity field and the
logarithmic differential of the wave function, respectively. It provides for the selfreferential closure of
the path around a singularity, which when mapped into a relaxed configuration elicits the torsion
(Burgers vector) as the anholonomity (Batterman [16]).
In the quantum geometry of state-spaces, projective Hilbert space, the path transports a wave
function which acquires a phase upon completion by closure. Yet this does not depend on the closed
path itself in distinction of the configuration “real”-space. However, the quantum geometry does have
a singularity which is the excluded null state. Furthermore, antipodal identification of quantum states
produces nonorientability (Bliokh et.al. [21], Rapoport [228]). Both singularities are usually
unacknowledged, whereas nonorientability has lately been found omnipresent. More of this below.
It has been lately acknowledged -and presently taken a widespread momentum- the relevance of the
quantum anholonomy and its omnipresence in quantum physics, electromagnetism, acoustics, pressure
waves, electronic devices, sound, gravity waves, fluids, crystals, etc. However, this has proceeded as
the unacknowledgement of the geometrical anholonomity of (“real”) space or spacetime torsion, rather
than state-space, say in dislocated crystals as elementary examples of torsion geometry, or quantum
fields associated to linear and non-linear Schroedinger and Dirac equations [207,208,217-219]. They
reveal the unity of continuity and singularities as discontinuities, much sought for in the search of a
theory of quantum gravity. (Yet seemingly impossible to achieve in terms of the metric geometries of
General Relativity which assume a continuous spacetime and null torsion; these assumptions imply no

selfreference nor primal singularities, by default, though solutions to the field equations show
otherwise). Furthermore they have brought to the fore the fundamental relevance of “non-conventional”
(viz. nonorientable) topologies. On the other hand the torsion geometries of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics, quantum physics and thermodynamics which was revealed in the works by Rapoport
have not been acknowledged. Furthermore, torsion has appeared in the qualitative studies of nonlinear
systems, particularly in blow-ups, chaos and bifurcations (Yong Wu and Yi Lin [286];Rapoport
[228,232,233]). For example, electromagnetic fields with Möbius strip polarizations were first
discovered in optics (Freund [54 ], Bauer et.al. [17], Andrews [7], Bliokh et.al. 21), to later extend this
discovery to tidal ocean waves, sound, fluids and particularly turbulence, gases, water-surfaces,
gravitational waves, which “show that polarization singularities and Möbius strips are also ubiquitous
for them. In contrast to well-studied electromagnetic polarizations associated with the motion of abstract
field vectors, acoustic wave polarizations correspond to real-space trajectories of the medium particles”
(Bliokh et.al. [21]). The robust quality of these topological singularities is relevant.Thus the abstract
state-spaces of quantum mechanics in terms of which quantum anholonomies were first discovered,
were anticipated by spacetime (“real-space”) effects such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect associated to
the primality of electromagnetic potentials, actually torsion potentials as appearing in the trace-torsion
differential 1-form of Cartan-Weyl type (Rapoport [202,203-210,212,217-220]) and in the Schroedinger
equation for open systems upon measurement of quantum geometry state-space (Rapoport [218]). They
were complemented by a plethora of space or spacetime quantum anholonomies associated to such
elementary phenomena such as geometrical-optics eikonal propagation of light, sound waves (Deymier
& Runge [43]), fluid and pressure waves, phonon vibrations on lattices, metamaterials, etc. The quantum
anholonomy has shown its omnipresence (Bliokh et.al. [2]1) to which we can add the universal
phenomena of resonance of harmonic systems which has nonorientabilty and quantum and classical
anholonomies for their very basis (Dembowski et.al. [122], Deymier & Runge [43], Xu et.al. [287]). It
has been empirically verified that resonance arises from tuning harmonic systems through the mediation
of nonorientable states (Shelton [249], Xu et.al. [287]).
In Steps to an ecology of mind, Bateson’s posthumous work on cybernetics, general systems theory
and the foundations of biosemiotics, he envisaged the existence of a universal transcendental metaform,
a “pattern which connects” (Brier [27]). We identified nonorientability as the characteristic property of
the connection pattern (Rapoport,[236]). As already mentioned, the Klein Bottle is the metaform of
both pattern formation and pattern recognition in Nature, and in the brain-mind connectome as an
harmonic system (Atasoy et.al. [8], Rapoport & Perez [234])
5. Anholonomies, nonorientability and chaos in the brain-mind dynamics
Nonorientability plays a crucial role in the theory of dynamical systems; we already mentioned the
blow-ups of nonlinear systems which lead to chaotic attractors. Due to the complexity of nonlinearity
which manifests in the asymptotic morphologies given by their attractors, particularly those that arise
as periodic orbits that makeup the unstable manifolds, this is perforce a qualitative theory. Topological
invariants are basic to characterize the complexity of the invariant manifolds of these attractors. The
reason is simple: stretching, folding, twisting, tearing, squeezing are the topological transformations
which nonlinear processes undergo in their phase spaces. However, the characterization of the
topological properties are much involved. One such topological invariant is an anholonomy, the so
called local torsion (Gilmore & Lefranc [61]). Indeed, consider a normal vector to a periodic orbit of
the solution flow of a dynamical system. As the flow evolves the base of the vector moves along the
orbit, the tip rotates along the direction of the flow. We are already familiar with this, the Möbius strip.
However, in this dynamical system flow, when the initial state returns to its starting point, the vector
rotates through an angle, Θ,precisely Θ/Π, the local torsion around the periodic orbit. The value of the
local torsion is generally not an integer. The latter are relevant to topology, nonorientability and
complexity. Say, if the local torsion around a closed period-n orbit is an even integer, then it is possible
for two orbits of period n to entwine the original period-n orbit. Otherwise, if the local torsion is an odd
integer, the original period-n orbit can be entwined by an orbit that closes after two cycles, i.e. a period2n orbit. This notion of anholonomity can be extended to nonlinear dissipative systems undergoing Hopf

bifurcations with a continuous symmetry (Ning & Haken [176]), which characteristically produce
nonorientable unstable periodic attractors.
Would we consider dynamical systems described by a vectorfield on 3d-Euclidean space, i.e. a field
of vectors in 3d space which evolve in time as a parameter, namely describable by a system of ordinary
differential equations. Since detailed description is not the issue but rather qualitative models which are
useful to capture the essential dynamics in the simplest low-dimensional model. Classical examples are
the Van der Pol equation, which models a simple electronic circuit exhibiting oscillations, and the
Lorenz system capturing the essence of complexity in weather models. Very often, as is also the case
with these examples, the resulting model is three-dimensional due to 3d-vectorfields being the lowestdimensional continuous time models that can exhibit extremely complicated behaviour, including chaos.
To understand the dynamics of such a vectorfield, we search for attractors, their basins of attraction and
in particular, the boundaries of these attracting domains. Two-dimensional invariant manifolds often act
as basin boundaries, and it is important to know for understanding the qualitative aspects which are the
very core of the theory of dynamical systems where they are located and their shapes. They are called
separating manifolds, as they separate the state-space into two invariant regions. Indeed, trajectories of
the solution flow of the dynamical system falling on one side of the manifold are trapped into to this
region since they cannot move through an invariant manifold. However, not every 2d-invariant manifold
is a separating manifold. Indeed, a separating manifold must have two sides, namely an inside and an
outside and it is the case that the nonorientability of Möbius strip and Klein Bottle unite them.Thus
invariant manifolds may be nonorientable and thus nonseparating, and this bears the signature of a
supradual logophysics. The particular feature of Euclidean 3d-space is that any nonorientable manifold
embedded in it is topologically equivalent to a Möbius strip. Already in 4d this is no longer the case.
In (Mindlin &Solari [166]) 2d surfaces contained in the 3d invariant manifolds of periodic orbits were
found, clear signatures of both orientable and nonorientable surfaces, invariant tori and Klein bottles in
a 4d flow, respectively. Thus the torus and the Möbius strip appear conspicuously while for 4d nonlinear
dynamical systems is the twisted torus and the Klein Bottle (Charó et.al. [34,35]). The complex topology
of attractors was considered initially as “fragile anomalies”, but this was meant in relation to Cantor
dust structures, rather than nonorientability, which was much disregarded.
This is of importance to the brain-mind would we consider it as a metastable chaotic system, having
electroencephalograms as the wave patterns for the stable functioning, which are organized as a series
of 2:1 Möbius strip harmonic series (Rapoport [236)]. The chaotic attractors which represent the 2:1
arms of the Hopf bifurcation say of the logistic map, elicit Möbius strips and Klein Bottles which are
pervasive to chaotic attractors, the unstable periodic orbits appearing in the models by Lorenz, Rössler
and others (Crawford & Omohundro [40], Meiske and Schneider [163]). This transition between chaotic
attractors of the nonlinear dynamics of neural circuits are conceived as the functional support for the
multistable switching between different perceptions or behaviours, say as in the Necker cube or Gestalt
figures, supporting the transition of the brain dynamics between different oscillatory states. This can be
conceived as the core of the dynamical systems approach to the neurosciences. Thus the nonlinear
metastable dynamics of the brain-mind produced by the cross-influence between the
electroencephalogram’s octave rhythmic progression, manifests as a sequential transition between nonorientable attractors, providing the basis for the self-organized control of a “communication-throughcoherence” (Battaglia et.al. [15]), resonance. Indeed, these different attractors would correspond to
different dynamical states of a fixed structural network. However, the metastable behaviour from which
the sequential chaotic attractors appear is conceived as a single ‘complex’ attractor, where the
complexity refers to the shape of the manifold drawn by the trajectory, which can be characterized as
a set of connected sub-manifolds, each capable of sequestering the trajectory for a limited period of time
(Rapoport [236]). They are connected to, or embedded in a larger surface in a way such that the
trajectory will find this connection and a new transient will emerge as the trajectory moves off to another
submanifold. The previous considerations can be extended with René Thom’s Catastrophe theory.
Following the Aristotelian revindication of morphology this theory claims the universality of some
forms, to account for the sudden abrupt transitions of nonlinear systems between regimes as universal,
following small changes in additional parameters. However, examined in a larger parameter space,
Catastrophe Theory reveals that such bifurcation points tend to occur as part of well-defined qualitative

geometrical-topological structures. Despite the number of discontinuities in Nature appear infinite in
variety, Thom showed that the graphs of these processes could be categorized into a few basic
shapes. The jump phenomena occur as the state of the system approaches local phase-space manifolds
(attractors) with different (non)orientability properties. In these cases the so-called invariant manifolds
describe the asymptotic- in- time geometry of the periodic oscillations, known as Instantaneous Centre
Manifolds. The instantaneity is related to the discontinuity in sudden regime change emerging as the
change of topology, in terms of orientability to nonorientability and the converse. They show the
archetypical form of infinity or 8, the lemniscal projection of the Klein Bottle, of the unstable periodic
orbits of chaotic attractors, say of Rössler and Lorenz. Current discoveries indicate the relevance of
knots (Kaufmann [126]) to the topologies of chaotic attractors (Charó et.al. [34,35]) suggested in
(Gilmore & Letelier [61]), following a theorem by Birman and Williams.
6. On the logophysical topological nature of the brain-mind: emotions, Markov blankets and
free energy principle
Nonorientability does not only appear in the chaotic attractors of the dynamical theory mathematical
treatment of neurons. Rapoport identified it in the vision of a subject which operates through
projectivity, as initiated by the Renaissance Masters which is crucial to the constitution of selfhood: the
topology of consciousness (Rapoport [236]). The young Sigmund Freud was a neurophysiologist in the
making, whose reflections on the psyche have become integral to the current developments of Biological
Psychology (Panksepp [182] ,Solms 259-262), and the neurosciences at large. In his Project for a
Scientific Psychology, Freud associated the brain’s resting state as constituting a spatiotemporal
structure supported by the brain’s neuronal structure for what he conceived as a “psychological
structure” of the ego for which he suggested a topological consideration (Northoff [177]). Freud referred
to this spatiotemporal anchoring of the psyche as “It must lie on the borderline between [our emphasis]
inside and outside; it must be turn outwards toward the external world and must envelop the other
psychical systems” (quoted by Solms and Panksepp, [126]). It is as if Freud unbeknownst on the Klein
Bottle had indicated its role as the integrated agency, psyche. Later on Jacques Lacan temptatively
pursued this further, alternatively choosing the 2-torus, which supports a banal form of selfreference
[239], and the Klein Bottle, yet with deep intuition indicating the importance of topological knots to the
psyche (Miller [165], Hewitson [85], Ragland [199]). This anticipated crucial notions of the psyche’s
operations which appear to indicate the Klein Bottle as the metaform for the spatialization of the psyche
elaborated by Rapoport. Phenomenological theoretizations calling for anchoring phenomenology on
topology, such as the works by Heidegger further elaborated by Malpas, with Stern, Rosen and
Rapoport’s identification of nonorientability for grounding phenomenology, for the latter not restricted
to physical space. Striving to find a quantum theory for the brain-mind, particularly in terms of quantum
field theory of open systems (Vitiello [278]), Globus referred to observational practices which appear
to indicate the spatiotemporal anchoring of the body-mind already displayed by the novelist Marcel
Proust. Globus’ proposal for the scientific study of consciousness [66] was to extend the third-person
account of the subject-observer by the praxis of first-order account. The latter was also proposed in the
Radical Neurophenomenology and biogenetic structuralism initiated by Laughlin et.al. [141]. It was
later pursued by Varela [276], Petitmengin [189]. Globus [66] pointed out to the ultimate spatialtemporal referral of consciousness somewhat treading on Heidegger’s conception for anchoring his
phenomenology (Malpas [155]) . The third-person account is the signature of objectivity practiced by
science curtailed by the lack of a supradual principle, requiring nevertheless to be completed by a firstorder account proper of the selfreference of consciousness. The notion pledged by Globus is the “inbetweeness” of phenomenology -just like Freud-, the world as experience, which he stops short of
linking with the Klein Bottle (personal communication to the author) yet linked to the “tilde” and “nontilde” states of Vitiello [278], Jibu and Yasue [123]; see also [120]. An important comment: as a field
anthropologist Laughlin remarked the intervention of rhythmic and resonance elements inducing altered
states of consciousness arising in rituals [142], and stressed their crucial character to consciousness
rather singularly. Nowadays has resurfaced in the neurosciences the appropriateness of claiming a
musical nature to the living brain (Bandyopadhyay [14]), which we suggested to be based on the Klein

Bottle metaform of pattern formation and pattern recognition at the brain connectome in terms of
harmonics [234] which may appear as cymatic patterns [8].
The experiences associated with the cognition of music have a signifying richness and ample spectra
perhaps unique and nonreproducible by any other sensorial stimulus but sound, besides its abstractness
perhaps comparable to the seemingly most abstract mathematics, say topoi and category theory
(Mazzola [159]). Returning to the anthropologist Laughlin’s interest for music and its embodiment
induced by brain entrainment through repetition and mimicry of animal motion through ritualisytic
performance, later validated by mirror neuron research, it has been ventured that it is music which
presents those consciousness states: They are brought to the mind by music and this is so in all states of
consciousness, mostly in states of unawareness (Addis [1]). In other words, Addis claims that music is
the rather unique agency which fully activates through the body-brain the spectra of consciousness
states and particularly emotions, which are conceived both in the neurosciences and Biological
Psychology after Panksepp [182], as the most elementary qualia. The latter conclusion was reached on
the studies of the anatomical and physiological evidence that led to conclude that the primary role of
consciousness is to scan the proper body states rather than the states of the seemingly independent
Exterior world (Solms & Friston [308]). In other words, the primary role of consciousness is
interoceptive, directed to the mind’s embodiment. The most elementary qualia require no cognitive nor
perceptual representations, they are the so-called called affections: hunger, lust, surprise or curiosity,
particularly aroused by sound. This is a radical departure of consciousness as primed on abstractions.
The experience of music is both a first-person and third-person issue, in the latter case providing for a
universal form of intersubjectivity, yet one which is anchored subjectively, in the sense of
interoceptiveness.
The first-person account is very much anchored through emotions, to which we shall return briefly.
Remarkably this notion of the embodied mind integrating interoprioception with exteroception is crucial
to the body-mind homeostasis-directed cybernetics. Freud’s conceptualization of the psyche has
influenced the cognitive neuroscience, for which the primal form of consciousness is grounded on
emotics operating through the limbic system (Damasio [41,42], Solms [261,262]). More recently Craig
has identified the middle insula as crucial to homeostatic sentience, and interoception and exteroception
integration, leaning on the motor aspect -rather than feelings- in the motor-perception cycle which
Turvey identified as a Möbius strip [273] and whose somatotopographic representation is supported by
the Klein Bottle [119,281]. See Craig [316.]
The spatialization structure in the neurosciences are referred to the mainly unconscious modeling
activity of the psyche in terms of a Markov blanket, a 4-state logophysics proposed by Friston [55]
which was identified as the Klein Bottle by Rapoport ([234,236]), further identifying the somatosensory
and visual systems Klein Bottle topographic representations of the body periphery through touch and
vision, respectively, as key Markov blankets integrations.
These considerations have arised through the search for the minimal conditions to ascribe feelings
to an entity, to be alive. A fundamental property of biological self-organising systems is their tendency
to resist the second law of thermodynamics. Friston characterized this functional property as emerging
in the conditions of ergodic random dynamical system that naturally arises within any such system that
possesses a Markov blanket. They are characterized by systems consisting in two sets: (‘sensory’ and
‘active’ states. They further influence each other in a selfreferential cycle fashion: [active] external
states [Outside–Outside; Klein Bottle-wise, as in the other states of the blanket] cause sensory states
which influence—but are not influenced by—internal states [Outside-Inside], while internal states
[Inside–Inside] cause active states which influence—but are not influenced by—external [Inside–
Outside] states” (Rapoport [236])
Together with a free energy principle the Markov blankets are the core of the developments in
neurosciences conceiving the brain-mind as operating through a Bayesian inferential process Actually
Solms identified any living biological system enclosed by a boundary as a Markov blanket ([262]; see
also [317]). Such is the case of the living cell organised with its membrane which is not amenable to
identification as a dual-logic gate (Rapoport [225], Ling [135]).The cell’s cytoplasm appear to operate
through the “like likes like” principle, introduced by Richard Feynman, which is crucial to the cell’s
metabolism (Pollack [193]) ], Ling [135]). and to the formation of coherent water domains. Of course,

Feynman’s principle expresses non-duality. This substantiates Spencer-_Brown’s conceptualization of
worlds arising from a reentering system defined by a primal distinction/boundary [303], a reentering
which cannot be supported by a 2d surface other than the selfpenetrating Klein Bottle
(Rapoport[231,232]). Boundaries rather than operating in a dualistic setting as merely defining the
system by the CONTAIN image-schema, as that what remains Inside -and thus a somewhat passive
object- and what is left Outside, are constitutive to the systems bounded by them rather than mere tokens
of separation (Celliers [311]).
The nonorientability decurring from antipodal identification of projectivity in the case of the visual
field, is crucial to the topology of consciousness, as we already referred to. In Algebraic Topology the
notion of blowup is introduced as a geometric transformation which replaces a subspace of a given
space with all the directions pointing out of that subspace. For instance, the replacement of a point by
the projectivized tangent space at that point. Remarkably we can generate the Möbius strip as the blowup of the origin of R2 replacing the plane with the projectivized tangent space. This is related to the
pinhole singularities of the visual cortex (Petitot [190] and its periodic architecture with its Klein Bottle
topology, and to the purported origin of the Universe through a Big Bang [236]. However, the
underlying conception proper to this is the so called resolution of singularities in Algebraic Topology,
which conceives it as zooming on a point, rather than an explosion. There is nothing that is that has
not already been, as another form, perhaps. No ex-nihilo. As already observed the event-horizon of the
Planck-scale singularities of the vacuum elicit non-orientability as the topology of the infinitesimal
boundary of the experientable. In short, the speculation of a subquantum void elicits a frontier to
cognition, which has the signature of nonorientability.
Whatever, this reflects the notion of spacetime as a product of the mind, conceived as a “geometric
agent”, which Piaget identified at the early stage of the child’s cognitive development. Kant: “Space is
a necessary a priori intuition, that lies at the root of every awareness. One cannot imagine its negation,
although one can imagine it to be empty. It is the necessary condition for the possibility of perception,
and not a consequence of perception, it is an intuition a priori, the necessary basis for external
perceptions”. (p. 38) (quoted from Northoff [177]) While space may be an existential precondition to
perception, the denial of the space-construal nature by the embodied mind has been disproved.
7. The Principle of Complementarity in cognitive psychology, torsion and nonorientability in
the homology of Inside and Outside representations
Shepard’s Principle of Complementarity conceives visual experience as arising from a priori embodied
structures, constraints operating on the construal of experience. Constraints arise from perception as
framed by the visual system, an ecological psychology. The crucial constraints arise from the perceived
locally Euclidean 3-dimensionality of space and of the objects placed as if contained in it. This appears
in principle as the usual conception of Cartesian space as a container, yet framed by perception.
However, objects appear through two-dimensional surfaces of their boundary, both of them as
characteristics of the perceived environment and our actions on them. So rather than staying on the 3dimensionality of objects, perception arise from their boundaries, and these are 2-dimensional. We can
conceive of this in terms of the complementarity of form, related to symmetry, with function, related to
asymmetry, first suggested by Pierre Curie. Biologist cum crystallologist Lima de Faria upholded this
principle for the very foundation for biology as selforganisation, and he argued that it may carry from
the level of elementary particles to higher forms [148].
This complementarity is already a Klein Bottle embodiment, as the right hand side rectangular
figure (see fig.3) shows its formation: two equally directed sides -the symmetry aspect- produce the
cylindrical shape, and the identification of the other directed sides -the asymmetrical aspect- produces
in turn the torsion towards the selfpenetration. Steven Rosen has called this a synsymmetry (Rosen
[241]). Without the asymmetrical aspect of synsymmetry Nature would be timeless, inert, functionless,
and without the symmetrical aspect the morphological regularity would not stand to shape it, as if inert,
yet in pregnant openness to change.
According to this, phenomenological space is 2-dimensional rather than 3-dimensional, alike in the
holography principle of physics [313], but embodied , for fundamental difference. Remarkably, the

16

visual receptive fields of the cortex are mathematically modeled as Gabor functions, of holography
theory. The built-in symmetry of these functions, as appear in their phases, is the Klein Bottle, 2dimensional. In other words: Phenomenology is related to 2-dimensional construal of experience, in
which holography is sustained by Gabor functions of receptive fields, yet to be able to perform pattern
recognition the selfpenetration of the Klein Bottle needs to be removed, and this is carried out in 4d or
5d (Rapoport [228]; Rapoport & Perez 2018 [234]).
At the basis of this mental construal which is further related to the physiologics of visual perception,
we retrieve torsion and nonorientability as the geometry-topology of the unconscious ongoing
modelization of the living brain of the kinematics of objects (Shepard [250,252,253], Carlton and
Shepard [49]). Actually, Shepard departed from the experience of music: the Tritone Paradox motion
inside an octave which moves as in Escher’s Ascending and Descending pivoting on the tritone halfway
[251], a Möbius strip [228])). The former was further pursued by Risset in the paradox of rhythm
perception (Risset [237],Vernooij et.al. [277])). Shepard further discovered that this geometrotopological principle extended to the unconscious modelization by the brain-mind of the kinematics of
objects offered to the subject.
Remarkably, there is an homology of the geometry of dynamics of space or spacetime and the
geometry of phenomenology, the world as experienced, particularly in the mathematical modelization
of the living brain-mind. Phenomenology points out to symmetries, nonorientability through the Cartan
torsion geometry that underlies the Erlangen Program as of XXth century (Sharpe and Chern [111]),
and the very organisation of the visual cortex with its π-periodic hypercolumnar structure underlying
the Klein Bottle and operating as the visual receptive fields [234]). This is further supported by the
human heart which rather than a pump it operates as a Möbius strip torsional motion, as elicited by
Francisco Torrent Guasp; see Kocika et.al. [104]). Or still further, the body architecture of fascia -the
connective tissue system [129] made of liquid crystals which extends from the cellular cytoskeleton to
connect the whole body and covers all tissues, muscle and bones, as lemniscal one-dimensional
projections of either the Klein Bottle or Möbius strip. We already mentioned the somatosensory
topographic map of touch with its Klein Bottle topology, which models on the primary somatosensory
cortex the skin periphery supporting thus the unity of action and perception, an homology which
comprises the lemniscal trace of the gait of mammals, flying and liquid inhabiting species. The
homology extends to the distortions of the perception of space and time, through subjective Lorentz
transformations, which show that “the subjective psychophysical laws of motion perception are relative
to the observer's reference frame and that the Lorentz transformations govern the relationships between
time, distance, and velocities of perceived events” (Caelli et.al. [114]). The visual system psychophysics
does not comply with the Galilean transformations but appears to repose on hyperbolicity. Remarkably,
there is a connection between hyperbolicity and nonorientability as shown in (Rapoport [228])).
Furthermore, there is a physiological connection between the subjective space-time and quantum
physics structures through what is conceived as the visual component of short-time memory, VSTM.
The capacity of VSTM is set both by information load and by number of objects: A racing driver or a
fighter pilot may reach a limiting velocity of processing of information in which there is a perceived
time dilation and space contraction which upon the subject’s attention fixation on the phenomenon it
may turn to be the final instant before crushing into an obstacle.
The point is that short-time memory is quantized as discovered by Juan Pascual-Leone [184], a
former disciple of Jean Piaget. He pioneered cognitive psychology, and in studying child development
claimed that topology is a primer on framing the cognition of children. According to Piaget, at the early
states of cognitive developments the child puts up elementary spatial representations which “are none
other than those relations which the geometricians tell us are of a primitive character, forming that part
of geometry called Topology, foreign to notions of rigid shapes, distances, and angles, or to mensuration
and projective relations” (see Piaget & Inhelder [319]). This does not disappear with the child’s
development. Indeed, spatial representations that form the elements of perception are not “based on a
fixed homogeneous space in the sense of geometry these representations have a dynamic situationdependent nature involving topological, projective and metrical aspects involving a complex structure
of parameters and interactions with other primitives” (Mausfeld, p.86 [115]) which participate with is
conceived as an innate system of organisation which support/produce appearances. This system is

attributed to the brain as a “geometrical engine” (Koenderik [105]). The fact that they are mostly
transparent to the final outcome operates a dimensional reduction, a process of integration which rather
than working through discrimination reduces the information to a small number of parameters referred
to as dimensions (Pang et.al. [183]). They early appeared in the pioneering visual research of Hubel and
Wiesel who primed object orientation as experienced in the primal visual cortex where visual
information is represented: topologically, a Klein Bottle. In the dynamical systems approach to the
neurosciences the dimensional reduction is referred to the low dimensional attractors, which we
discussed in a previous section. This also suggests that together with the spikes, neuron action potentials
attribution of a dual logic, there is a coordination which in that paradigm is related to mitigation of the
discrete character attributed to them and the necessity of reducing noise. We shall return to this below.
However, psychologists have discovered that attention has “ a quantitative dimension in terms of
the maximum number of items to which a person can attend at one time” (Weiss & Weiss [280]). The
limits were indeed the case, yet rather than fixed and uncontextual,they have a plastic character
subjectable to learning and other factors. In distinction with symmetries as the logophysical constraints
in the unconscious modeling of object kinematics, in the case of attention it is the range of the number
of objects or mental states which an observer can attend to, which also led to the so-called magic rule
of 7 plus minus 2. Pascual Leone discovered that this space of objects subjected to attention appears to
follow up an Einstein-Bose statistics, it is a bosonic-like space of objects vis-à-vis attention [280]. From
this followed the proposal by Weiss & Weiss “… that memory span has to be understood as the quantum
of action of thought. In fact, this quanta of action represent macroscopic ordered states in the sense of
quantum mechanics”. VSTM representations are stored by means of sustained firing of action potentials,
which corresponds to a supradual logophysics, to be discussed below. So the visual space on which
subjective relativity operates through VSTM is quantized: Unlike the theory of spacetime of objects as
contained in physical “real” space, where in principle the homogeneity and continuity is posited, the
visual space of experience as entertained by attention, does not need to search for a physical quantum
basis: The singularity is the viewing subject, very much alike in the very definition of torsion when we
supersede the primality of physical space as if exterior to our nature. The subject as the primal
distinction, as offered by Spencer-Brown [303], and identified as a torsion geometry by Rapoport [231].
8. The hard problem of consciousness and the torsion of cognition
We have presented the relation of the five-fold structure to dynamical torsion geometries and
nonorientable topologies pervasive to Nature. Rather than a purely algorithmic static structure it turned
out to be related to a vortical universal dynamics which comprises both the material and cognitive
domains. Particularly, so called chaotic systems appear to indicate a supradual logophysics, an issue
which has been disregarded. These topologies embody harmonics and thus transpired that Nature is
fundamentally related to harmonic principles, as already arises in genomes, in the brain connectome,
and in the Principle of Complementarity of cognitive psychology, further substantiated in (Rapoport
[236]).The mysterious nature of resonance has turned out to be supported on nonorientability,which is
also evident in the dynamical system models of neurons, the polyrhythmicity of motion as reflected by
the brain-mind, and the topographic maps of the visual and somatosensory modes. Actually the latter
somatosensory topography which is crucial to the constitution of the ‘body image’ does so by further
integration of the projection zones of the other sensory modalities, themselves consisting of topological
maps of different sensory organs (Solms and Panksepp, [126]; Craig [316] ). Thus, rather than a Klein
Bottle topology for the somatosensory modality, this further integration indicates a HyperKlein Bottle.
The supradual logophysics is keenly related to selfconsciousness, on the one hand by the ‘body image’
of selfhood, as experienced by the subject contemplating a distant point at the horizon [236]). While the
so called Hard Problem of consciousness as the quest to identify the ‘source of consciousness’ points to
emotions, as sustained by Biological Psychology after Panksepp and upholded in the neurosciences
(Solms & Turnbull [259]), there is much empirical evidence that resonance is the ‘gluing’ phenomenon
producing the synchronicity of the brain-mind as a whole, and of many-minds (Hunt & Schooler [88]).
This biological base for emotions somehow contrasts with the prevalent notion that consciousness stems
from complex computation among a network of simple neurons which each receives and integrates

synaptic inputs to a threshold which performs a kind of implicit gate to a dual-logic firing/non-firing
logic, which as we shall discuss below, is currently disproved. The other approach to understand
consciousness queries on the origin of cognition as how it originates from cognitive processes
accompanied or driven by phenomenal conscious experience and subjective feelings, referred to by
philosophers as ‘qualia’. This is the so qualified “Hard Problem” of consciousness. Whatever the
difficulty is, we face the problem of understanding the nature of distinctions between awareness and the
major form of consciousness. After all, “qualia” do not disappear in consciousness at all, whatever the
form or degree. We see the redness of an apple while awaken or dreaming, not to mention the intensity
of qualia in other altered states of consciousness. Much of what is unavailable to awareness and performs
in seemingly autonomic form which never is the case as the so-called Autonomous Nervous Systems –
a component of the peripheral nervous system. It regulates involuntary physiological processes , say
heart rate, blood pressure, etc.; it is not isolated from the environment through its connection to the
Central Nervous System. Its coupling to it appears to be embodied as a Klein Bottle topology as the
somatosensory and visual systems, cogent to the unity of action and perception (Turvey [273]). The
same problem arises in attempting to define Life, from the perspective of dualism [230], since it already
denies a continuity from the physical-chemical level to the biological one, as viruses show to be
mediating states which remarkable have a remarkable geometric complexity. Distinctions between
conscious and unconscious are not amenable to be conceived in dual terms, as we shall meet upon
discussing anaesthetics as well as other states of altered states of consciousness, those of enhancement
of its functionality. To the query posed by the Hard Problem, Biological Psychology has pointed out
to emotions as having the inherent quality from which experience can be anchored to. Solms: “An
explanation of experience will never be found in the function of vision—or memory, for that matter—
or in any function that is not inherently experiential. The function of experience cannot be inferred from
perception and memory, but it can be inferred from feeling… affection” (Solms, [261,262]). As for the
function of affects “ feeling enables complex organisms to register—and thereby to regulate and
prioritize through thinking and voluntary action—deviations from homeostatic settling points in
unpredicted contexts”. So they cannot be conceived as performing in terms of dual logic, rather
analogics appears to be the case. As uniquely elaborated by Antonio Damasio, from his clinical work
with brain-body damages or amputations, emotions also provide for the basis of the most complex forms
of consciousness, as presented in his extraordinary The Strange Order of Things ([41,42]).
Consciousness is primally interoceptive, it registers the state of the subject, not of the object world. “The
sentient subject is first and foremost an affective subject. Only then can it experience perceptual and
cognitive representations… The subject of consciousness is primary. The secondary (perceptual and
cognitive) form of consciousness is achieved only when the subject of consciousness feels its way into
its perceptions and cognitions, which are unconscious in themselves” (Solms , ibid). This selfreferential
nature of elementary consciousness does not breed in isolation but rather in relation to the environment,
in mammals in the maternal uterus and interacting with it through the umbilical chord nurturing matter
and through sound, as the most fundamental form of sensing in direction to alterity. The complex
mammal-to-be-born with relation to the maternal being is a HyperKlein Bottle. Resonance as the most
fundamental primarily exteroceptive form of communication of the feeling of what happens as referred
to the Outside Other.
Emotions are supported by selfreference and hetero-reference, self and alter-directed and/or
experienced, supradually. Empathy in its wide spectra appears to be related to resonance, as the
experience of music shows to be the case. While a form of panpsychism which evades identification
might be attributed to Nature ( Skrbina [257],) the supradual logophysics of the Klein Bottle is based
on the principles of selfreference and hetero-reference, both torsion and nonorientability, as if
independently of the existence of a subjective agency. It is known in neurophysiology that selfreference
is fundamental to the brain-mind, and as the mirror-neuron phenomenology shows it is undissociable
from hetero-reference: There is no Self without Other, as the so called mirror neurons phenomenology
has exposed. Interoception is unseparable from our perspectival alter-related mutual construal be that
of reality, the imaginal or ideational domains, mimetics, having resonance and empathy for its vehicles
(Baiano et.al. [10 ], Rizzollati et.al. [238], Ferrari et.al. [50]): Its chameleonic nature a disproof of the
hegemonic attribution of the primality of the dual logophysics.

As for the origin of emotions has been proposed that the interoception scanning primary intention
of consciousness establish a sense of value related to the preservation of existence. Spinoza gave it a
name, conatus [308]. It is a selfreferential process which elicits intentionality, selfreferentially:
preservation of being. It is being sensed as the different states of homeostasic regulation. The dynamics
of this process is embodied as a Markov blanket [55,307], which we already identified as a Klein Bottle
architecture.
9. The supradual phenomenology of neuronal action potentials and topological phases
An important role of the receptive field -whose Gabor function representation first introduced in
holography has a phase with a builtin Klein Bottle symmetry (Tanaka [268,269])- is the enabling of
cell-to-cell communication through the action potentials. All of information of the outside world arrives
through patterns of action potentials created at one of five sensory organs. Action potentials occurs
when the membrane potential of a specific cell location rapidly rises and falls; the current paradigm
attribute this to ion current transport. This depolarization in turn causes adjacent locations to similarly
depolarize. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include
neurons, muscle cells, endocrine cells and in some plant cells. Action potentials support the propagation
of signals along the neuron’s axon toward synaptic boutons, the axon terminals, small swellings situated
at the ends of an axon. Synaptic boutons are typically the sites where synapses with other neurons are
found, and neurotransmitters are stored here to communicate with other neurons via these synapses.
These signals can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands.
Let us start by noting that the neural network operation is not a matter of separate elements. This
already dispels the notion that a dual gate phenomenology could support this connectivity, it rather
elicits a contextuality, which already the Klein Bottle embodies. Indeed, a typical neuron receives
inputs from thousands other neurons through the contacts on its dendritic tree called synapses. The
inputs produce electrical transmembrane currents that change the membrane potential of the neuron.
Synaptic currents produce changes, the so called postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). Small currents
produce small PSPs; larger currents produce significant PSPs that can be amplified by the voltagesensitive channels embedded in the neuronal membrane and lead to the generation of an action potential
or spike – an abrupt and transient change of membrane voltage that propagates to other neurons via a
long protrusion called an axon. Such spikes are the main means of communication between neurons.
Spikes tune the time for cognition and manage the times of firing, so they perform as time-operators.
We continue by dispelling the notion that complex behaviour may be necessarily related to a
complex network of neurons, a connectome dynamics (Atasoy et.al. [8]), but rather is based from an
ecological integration of the living organism with its environment. Such an integration is the Klein
Bottle embodiment. A paramount example is Paramecium, a unicellular organism, which swims in its
habitat. Paramecium is a single spiking “neuron”; there is no connectome to this organism, and yet
it can accomplish a variety of ecologically relevant tasks. It performs and controls complex navigation
in crowded multisensory environments, practices accordingly social behaviour, sexual mating, and
spatial memory might also be the case. Its motions with multiple cilia -mainly constituted by
microtubules- is vortical. However, this does not arise from the complexity of the cell but “rather from
the interaction between this spiking cell and the environment, together with the exploratory properties
conferred by the pseudo-random nature of the effect of a spike [referring to the trial-and-error
pragmatics of Paramecium in search for nurture]. This highlights the importance of embodiment and
coupling with the environment, which are increasingly appreciated in cognitive science and philosophy
of mind” (Brette [26])
In general neurons do not fire on their own; they fire as a result of incoming spikes from other
neurons. If wished their identity as action is not entirely proper but a resultant of the endogenous and
exogenous influence. As already said, there is no Self without Alter. In other words the CONTAIN
image-schema appears to be inapplicable to the individual neuron in a collective of neurons . Hence,
neurons are said to fire and yet they can be characterized as being fired. This, we claim, is the signature
of the Klein Bottle supradual logophysics. Thus, there is an inherent “circularity” to the behaviour of
neurons, which being associated to a joint selfreference and hetero-reference, it is associated to a

HyperKlein Bottle cybernetics, rather than a dual logic associated to the membrane and its
electrochemical potential. Yet, not only a collective of neurons are involved in the spike formation and
propagation, neurotransmitters are required for this propagation. The usual paradigm claims that action
potentials are caused by ion currents which diffuse inside the neuron and when reaching and surpassing
a threshold the spike is produced.
The mathematical model for action potentials as arising from ionic currents is the Hogdkin-Huxley
model (HHM), which describes neuronal dynamics in terms of activation and inhibition of voltage-gated
conductances. An important hypothesis of the HHM is that neurons are dynamical systems, and thus
described by a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations. HHM is used together with the claim
that the continuous action potentials can be reduced to sudden appearance of peaks called “spikes” to
posit the dual logic; this is done in terms of the individual neuron presumably upon surmounting a
threshold voltage which thus fires producing the spike or otherwise stays quiescent not producing it at
all. In HHM biological neurons are dual-logic gates working through an “integrate-and-fire” scheme
based on comparison, a difference-producing-differences process, after Bateson: Firstly, |a cell body
(soma) and several branched dendrites receive and integrate synaptic inputs as action potentials. Then, a
comparison between the action potential and the integrated threshold potential at the axons initiation
segments takes place, when the latter reaches the former value then a dual all-or-nothing “spike”, or
action potential as output and transmitted across the axon. The issue left unresolved by this dual
logophysics is what makes the comparison, in the first place. In closer examination it further produces
an infinite regress proper to its first-order cybernetics based on dual logic onto-epistemology [234,236].
However, further examination of this model does not support its in dual logic preconception,
which is rather hegemonic in the sciences (Rapoport [230]). Izhikevich: “The irony is that the HodgkinHuxley model does not have a well-defined threshold; it does not fire all-or-none spikes; and it is not an
integrator, but a resonator, it prefers inputs having certain frequencies that resonate with the frequency
of subthreshold oscillations of the neuron” (p.2 [91]). As for establishing an adequate methodology,
Fitzhugh concluded his mathematical modeling of threshold phenomena by saying that “…many
neuronal properties are invariant under continuous, one-to-one transformations of the coordinates of
phase space and fall within the domain of topology…the most logical procedure in the description of a
complex biological might be to characterize the topology of its phase space, then to establish a set of
physically identifiable coordinates in the space, and finally to fit differential equations to the
trajectories” [315]. Upon examining the HHM attractors, nonorientable twists were discovered in the
phase space chaotic attractors (Guckenheimer & Labouriau [70]). Rather than subthreshold, a
conceptual hindrance of the assumption of dual logophysics, the more appropriate term would be
subcellular or cytoskeletal.
However, it has been empirically verified that neurons operate as resonators (see Izhikevich [91]);
hence, dual logic is not the case for the basis of neuronal phenomenology. Yet this resonator character
turned out to be the core of what is conceived as a novel paradigm for the neurosciences elaborated by
Anirban Bandyopadhyay and collaborators, the Hindu group [14,64,246,254-256]. Already in 2014
Hameroff and Penrose [75] appealed to the empirical findings of this group as support for their ORC
OR theory, and very recently further promoted them for a novel paradigm for the neurosciences. Their
elaboration is quite distinct with the present Klein Bottle logophysics, disregarding the torsion geometry
and topological issues, not mentioning the topological phases in the cytoskeleton and the shape of action
potentials, nor the deep connections to cognition and perception, topological chemistry and
nonorientability of liquid crystals, which are crucial to the supradual Klein Bottle logophysics.
Already visual receptive fields do not operate in terms of dual logic: the consideration of context
such as central locus and periphery elicits a non-dual logic by which neurons are in a state of
superposition of firing and non-firing, inhabitation and activation superposed, yielding a 4-state Klein
Bottle logophysics (Rapoport [228]).
Redirecting our attention to the so called cytoskeletal structures and processes we first remark
their association to the filamentary structures of the neuron. Focusing the attention on the spikes in
disregard of the phenomena being produced on the subthreshold and before actual spikes firing is very
much in ignorance of the complexity and information associated to it. Indeed, the current spike duallogic based paradigm ignores all components beneath the neuron membrane - fundamentally the

cytoskeleton, tagging them as inconsequential: the prejudice of the neural membrane as a dual gate is
hegemonic. We turn to this now.
The cytoskeleton is basically made of proteins, the most remarkable proteins are the molecular
motors, the so called motor molecules which play a crucial role in the cytoskeletal dynamics. Indeed,
motor proteins operate transporting membrane-enclosed organelles or changing the shape of structures
built from cytoskeletal filaments (Alberts et.al. [5]). In other words, in the latter case motor proteins
operate as topological agencies. They bind to a polarized cytoskeletal filament and use the energy
derived from repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis to move steadily along it. Dozens of different motor
proteins coexist in every eukaryotic cell. They differ in the type of filament they bind to (either
microtubules or actin), the direction in which they move along the filament, and what they carry.
The cytoskeleton is a protein lattice which has three kinds of filaments, microtubule made of
tubulin, neurofilaments, and microfilaments (actin). Microtubules are hollow cylindrical tubes with
outer diameter of 25 nm and inner diameter of 14 nm with thirteen linear tubulin
chains (‘protofilaments’) aligning side-to-side to form the hollow microtubule Given the large
surface area inside and outside the tube, ordered water domains are considered to be bound to
microtubules. These ordered water domains are crucial to metabolism and to the overall coherence of
organisms [79,80,135,168-170,193]. Due to their uniaxial symmetry rather than having the topology of
the abstract projective space (Machon and Alexander [153,154]), given that organisms are bounded
rather than extending to infinity, they are characterized by Möbius strips due to the antipodal
identifications of points at the boundaries supporting nonorientability (Rapoport [228]). Remarkably,
in the case of vision this supports the establishment of a sense of selfhood ([236]). In other words,
already coherent water domains have the selfreferential nonorientable shaping as a form of
protoconsciousness.
Using the quantum field theory for condensed matter systems it has been argued that microtubule
cavities with water in their vicinity could support superradiance, i.e. collective infrared photon emission
by water molecules known as superradiance. Pollack showed that coherent water domains are produced
by electromagnetic absorption by regular water, and upon electromagnetic emission a cycle of
coherence/decoherence of water is produced. Also a coupling between the water molecules inside the
cavity of the microtubule and the tubulins that build up the microtubule walls may produce
superradiance (Pollack [193]). In the case of coherent water domain, the supradual like likes like
principle operates towards their formation, hence we may venture whether this also applies to the
allosterics of water in the coupling of tubulin aggregating into microtubules, as a shaping typical of
aromatic molecules behaviour.
It has been argued that the ordered water domains environment of microtubules could produce a
dissipationless transfer of energy on neuronal microtubules due to the collective coherent behaviour.
This transport would be supported by electromagnetic sine-Gordon solitons (Georgiev [59]). They are
solutions to a non-linear Schroedinger equation, and as such associated to a torsion geometry of vacuum
Brownian fluctuations (Rapoport [219]). Remarkably sine-Gordon solitons support Möbius strips as the
edge of knots in the 2-torus phase-space of coupled oscillators [116]. They appear as the dynamical
system attractors of the “mental” rotations discovered in the cognition of music and in the nonlinear
dynamical systems of coupled oscillators say of two tonically spiked neurons , whose behaviours is
represented by the strange attractors of their dynamics (Izhikevich, [91]). We shall return to this below.
Since superradiance is not exclusive to microtubule interaction with the coherent water domainsindeed it is the case of genomes as real-space nonorientable configurations [233]- Georgiev argues that
it further requires to examine the interaction of microtubules terminals with MAPs (microtubule applied
proteins) or motor proteins. We shall see later that this produces nonlinear elasticity buckling patterns
as a solitary wave on a Möbius strip surface.
Cytoskeletons conform a tensegrity structure, a scaffold-like structure made of proteins
intermittently folding and unfolding, assembling and disassembling (Ingber [117]). In neurons
microtubules prevail and are uniquely stable; their collapse is related to the evanescence of
consciousness, say under anaesthesia. In the general case microtubules are highly dynamic as they
alternate in a cycle of alternative depolymerization and polymerization, known as dynamic instability.
In this sense they resemble the superradiance cycle of formation and disgregation of coherent water

domains by alternative absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation already introduced.
Notably Voeikov proposed this cycle as the very signature of the origin of life [279]. Some specific
MAPs bind to the terminal sector of microtubules thus controlling their dynamics and attachments to
other cellular structures. Other specific MAPs attach to microtubules along their entire length such as
α-tubulin and β-tubulin thus modulating microtubule functionality. The molecular patterns generated by
them conform the so called tubulin code which control microtubule behaviour. Remarkably, the tubulin
code does not operate as a dual switch, but rather analogically as a fine regulator (Janke & Magiera
[93]). In other words, the dual logophysics of microtubule functionality is not the case.
The notion of the cell as a tensegrity architecture provides a model to understand the processes
subjacent to cell shape, movement and cytoskeletal mechanics, cells sensing and response to mechanical
forces as well as cell differentiation and tissue development. Thus they perform as a cognitive-like
structure which has adaptative behaviour. This is particularly notable in the behaviour of ciliate colonies
-cilia are microtubules- for which the vortical metaform of motion as a shape of in-formation acting as
the logophysical agency at some level being reproduced at another level of organisation: They manifest
a natural intelligence as a mimetic reproduction of vortices (Ben Jacob [19]).This isomorphism surges
from the common nonorientability of genome sections [233], the lemniscal 1d-projections of Möbius
strip inscribed as the gait patterns in different media -swimming in the former case [18], nonorientability
of sound and electromagnetic waves [7 ,43], and still in the topological multiconformation of organic
molecules, to be discussed below. The latter is basic to ORC OR theory in the superposition of protein
conformations.
Filaments look alike nano-wires which are densely packed in neurons, and as a tensegrity structure
they are somewhat reductively considered as providing a tensile resisting skeleton. Thus, they resemble
electronic devices such as resonators, which upon assembling on Möbius strip shape, the signals
transmitted by them are somewhat liminal to the classical-quantum usual divide, to be later discussed.
Tensegrities model the mechanical behaviour of the cell as it emerges from physical interactions among
the different molecular filament systems that form the cytoskeleton and its role orienting much of the
cell's metabolic and signal transduction machinery. Furthermore it elicits that a single physical control
parameter, cell shape distortion through gradual variations can switch cells between distinct gene
programs (e.g. growth, differentiation and apoptosis). This process can be viewed as a biological phase
transition, in which mechanical distortion of cells and of their cytoskeleton through cell surface integrin
receptors profoundly affect cell behaviour.
That the cytoplasm is such a tensegrity structure having tensile and compressive elements is well
established and particularly microtubules are under compression due to tension generated by actin
filaments and the so called cytomusculature (Hameroff, [73]). Microtubules form a scaffoldlike
selfsupportive structure without contact among them. Furthermore, there is a complex torsion
architecture organized in terms of microtubules with contractile actin filaments spirally winding around
them, actually with the two opposite directions alike a spinning top which may cause rotational
oscillations. The figure that appears is of a cytoskeletal tensegrity dynamical structure “twisting back
and forth, even “rockin’ and rollin’!” (Hameroff, p.170 [73]). Currently, this complex structure
associated to resonances has been empirically probed by Bandyopadhyay and collaborators, using novel
scanning techniques.
10. Introducing the torsion dynamics of microtubules
Astrophysicist N.A.Kozyrev following his discovery of the existence of a nonlocal field of stars along
their past, present and future percourse in time as an holographic-like anticipative memory (Kozyrev, [
108-110]; Lavrentiev [143-145 ], Eganova [46], Korotaev [106]) which he attributed to a spinning
torsion field, he studied the behaviour of spinning tops. Seemingly, Kozyrev was not aware of the joint
work of Einstein and Cartan introducing torsion to spacetime geometry (Debever [298]) which failed to
identify the significance of torsion as a gravitational field element due to the omission of macroscopic
spin (Goenner [67]). Kozyrev’s findings of anomalous behaviour of weight variations of spinning tops
were reproduced by Hayasaka and Takeuchi [78]. Remarkably, Kozyrev’s initial hypothesis was that
the existence of an irreversible thermodynamical process as the local manifestation of the action-at-a-

23

distance. His conception of time was radically different to the usual time-parameter descriptor of change.
According to Kozyrev in these irreversible processes what manifests is that time has a stufflike
character: On the one hand being heterogeneous its manifestation depends on what the system it acts
upon is like; secondly it establishes a primality of cause-effect, so time is more about timing (i.e. a timeoperator) and its form is vortical, and thus the effect of this timing is the functionality and form of the
system itself. Alike a vortex it selforganizes viz-a-viz the environment and the morphing effect is the
system itself. A similar conception in relation to torsion and blow-ups of nonlinear systems was
developed by Soucheng OuYang and Jeffrey Yi Lin Forest (see [286]).
For a proof of Kozyrev’s findings of a torsion field which operates as an anticipative holographic
memory it only takes to look at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, to find a megaparsec size
Möbius strip of light (Molinari et.al. [291]). In Bohm’s conception of the quantum world as structured
in terms of an “explicit” and “implicit” orders in terms of the so-called quantum potential, which is
related to the electromagnetic torsion potential under the eikonal light-ray constraint and also arising in
the Schroedinger equation as a torsion field, Bohm and Hiley- invoked a “prespace” [292,294]. This
prespace is a byproduct of the nonlinear interference wave patterns from which in-formation surges by
beaming ligthwaves upon them. They described this prespace as topological, and algebraically by
Clifford algebras [28].The shapes of the latter whenever their phases possess an inhomogeneous
distribution- which is as well the case of holograms, are non-orientable Möbius strips (Freund [54],
Bauer et.al. [17], Bliokh et.al. [21] ).
Would we consider the living cell, say a neuron, its cytoskeleton, water and interactions with
vacuum fluctuations and still producing and absorbing electromagnetic waves and vibrations, we find a
very complex fractal tensegrity architecture in which different periodicities operate in a ample range of
frequencies and resonances elicit the overall coherence. Actually the investigation of this architecture
has led to conceive the cytoskeleton as a time-crystal by which the cytoskeleton is under perpetual
change in a pattern which is periodically repeated [14]. In any given cycle the system may be in a phase
in a non-equilibrium state, in which the system appears to be in a thermodynamical irreversible state.
So returning to Kozyrev’s conception of time as an operator causing an irreversible process as it
morphs in different vortical structures such as proteins, tubulin, microtubules, we can further examine
the torsion geometry of this.
In the study of the torsion geometry of thermodynamical irreversible processes and of Brownian
motions (Rapoport [210,227]), or still in the equivalence of the Maxwell equation of electromagnetism
and the Dirac-Hestenes equations of relativistic quantum mechanics upon examining the Helmholtz
decomposition (extended to differential forms on manifolds, the deRham-Kodaira-Hodge theorem) of
the trace-torsion differential one-form (or its metric- conjugate vector field) we identified the terms
related to irreversibility. It is the non-exact gradient trace-torsion terms: a divergenceless co-closed term
and an harmonic term. The harmonic term is both divergenceless and closed, its differential is null.
These can be also thought as electromagnetic one-forms, the harmonic term has a zero-field, alike an
Aharonov-Bohm potential term [206,208,217]. These terms may support topological anholonomities
and are further related to the phenomenon of resonance as interaction-at-a-distance. Furthermore, what
this elicits is a dynamical torsion given by differential one-forms, like the electromagnetic potentials
which in fact is a trace-torsion Cartan-Weyl 1-form, say Q, yet whose electromagnetic field dQ -d being
the differential operator- is a differential 2-form, say F as in electromagnetism, which is null [84]: In
other words a dynamical torsion producing null “curvature”. This is in stark contrast with null torsion
metric geometry with non vanishing curvature which is postulated by Penrose and Hameroff in their
ORC OR theory. We claim that this choice of geometry -as in General Relativity- defined by metrics,
to be entirely unrelated to what Hameroff described as the rock-and-roll microtubule having tubulin
helices morphing inhomogeneously as an invertible gyroscope either supported on any of its extremes,
producing an inhomogeneous vortex at the same time.
It is this behaviour which we suggest to be the underlying process for the collapse of microtubules
subjected to tubulin loads, while in the present setting the coherence is no longer an action-at-a-distance;
more of this below. In other words, the collapse has to do with a thermodynamical irreversible process
in which rotations indeed intervene as Hameroff early observed to be the case of microtubules dynamics.
Alternatively can be conceived as the vorticity turbulence producing term of the velocity of a viscous
24

fluid satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid-dynamics, or the equations of magneto-fluiddynamics [211-217]. This is in stark contrast with null torsion metric geometry with non vanishing
curvature which is postulated by Penrose and Hameroff in their ORC OR theory, to be discussed below.
We early suggested that the continuity of the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix together with
the confinement of the nonorientable coherent water domains basic to cellular metabolism, rather than
making of a cell’s membrane a semipermeable dual gate it performs an integration supported by local
nonorientable membrane topology. According to Ingber, integrin receptors, critical mechanosensitive
molecules and cellular components integrate the cell’s Inside and Outside. So we can identify the
nonorientability of Möbius strip elasticity as a supradual protoform of agency, a topological
“protoconsciousness”, though not necessarily ascribed to a living agent, but a function arising from the
interaction of the microtubule with the environment, particularly by additional load producing a change
of shape and order. This is still more patent upon considering that crystalline ribbons made of a
compound of niobium and selenium, NbSe3 - non ascribable to the constituents of a living structure- in
view of its inherent rigidity, which would be expected to prevent it from either bending or twisting, may
conform as Möbius strips (Tanda et.al. [270]).
For a proof of concept, we note that selfassembled viral membranes were shown to have scalloprodlike units selforganising into Möbius conformations at the membrane edge (see Gibaud et.al. [60]).
We must recall that viruses are crystal structures intermediary to geometrical lifeless structure and living
organisms. Indeed they carry genetic material, reproduce and evolve ascribed to natural selection.
Alternatively, in the self-organising theory, free of Darwinian natural selection attribution, which is
conspicuous to crystal structures, the natural selection process can be left aside, as argued by Lima de
Faria. However viruses lack the key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered
necessary criteria for defining life.
Given the importance of proteins to the cytoskeleton, we proceed to the shapes and regularities
which are elicited by them. Palindromic sequences are abundant in proteins. Palindromes, say
“neuquen”, “ana”, “somanydynamos”, are topologically supported by collapsed 2-tori and Möbius
strips, are crucial to genomes and their evolution (Rapoport [233,234]). Studies have shown that
reversing the sequence leads to the production of the same 3d protein fold or still its enantiomer (Sheari
et.al. [117]). This is most remarkable since it indicates that the 3d structure of proteins may be related
to a lower dimensional -actually a 2d Möbius strip- metaconfiguration, the untwisted orientable case
corresponding to the symmetric former case. Thus, the principle of “multiple identity” or, if wished
“split personality” appears also to be the case of proteins, contradicting thus the principle of identity
basic to dual logic.
This is still more notable following the topological studies of protein domains in terms of relational
representation of protein domains using the locations of the backbone atoms and the hydrogen bonds,
which allows a construal of a combinatorial object – a so-called fatgraph. Despite that the space of
possible protein structures appears vast and continuous, and the complexity of the relationship between
primary, secondary and tertiary structure levels, fatgraphs allow for a discrete representation from which
a 2d-surface appears as the ultimate representation. This surface can be topologically represented as
gluing 2-tori (viz bagel-shaped) and Klein Bottles. The former represents a banal selfreferential figure
where CONTAIN is structured surrounding an excluded central singularity in a rigid relation -a hole
which is part of the whole yet as if excluded (Rapoport [235]). The latter embodies the dynamical
contextualization of protein domains vis-à-vis the environment relatable to the instability of protein
conformations. In other terms, a juxtaposition of duality and supraduality, of permanence and mutability.
The gluing of orientable 2-torus and Klein Bottles that lie as the topological structure of proteins elicits
the multiconformation of proteins as possible modifications between the two forms of organisation visà-vis the environment: the closed organisation given by the tori, the open-closed given by the Klein
Bottle elements, and the possibility intertransformations due to electron delocalization. Given that the
Klein Bottle through its Hadamard matrix representation is the single operator which allows to transcend
classical computations it is these elements which support this transcendence as quantum computations
(Aharonov [3]). Furthermore, since the Klein Bottle operates on its own superposition states to produce
Boolean states as a topological decoherence, as much as reiterating its action now on the Boolean states
recovers its own coherence as topological superposition, then these nonorientable elements of protein
25

domains control not only the quantum computations but also the transformations to dual logic elements
and futher the reconstitution of quantum computation in the second phase of the cycle. Actually, as
observed in (Hameroff et.al., [74]) “protein conformational dynamics suggest that protein
conformational states—fundamental information units (‘bits’) in biological systems—are governed by
quantum events, and are thus perhaps akin to quantum bits (‘qubits’) as utilized in quantum computation
… signaling, communication and conductivity in MTs, and theoretical models have predicted both
classical and quantum information processing in MTs”. As related to their relevance “Quantum
processes such as electron tunneling, delocalization, and superposition could, therefore, couple to
nuclear locations and influence conformational changes, particularly if the quantum processes are
collective and self-organized. Proteins may be designed to amplify these quantum processes. Within
proteins ideal sites for electron delocalization are hydrophobic pockets (sites of anaesthetic effect), in
particular those containing aromatic rings like that of tryptophan” (ibid.). We shall return to this upon
discussing ORC OR theory.
Tubulin dimers are arranged not only in vortical shaped protofilament chains forming thus the
microtubules. They further form a particular skewed hexagonal lattice whose crystal structure gives rise
to helical winding patterns with regular repeat intervals. Increasingly steep winding patterns complete
one cycle around the cylinder at a certain number of tubulins above where the cycle started. These
numbers, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc. follow the well known Fibonacci series and whose sequential ratios
𝐹𝑁 / 𝐹𝑁+1 tend to approximate the Golden Mean, reproducing thus the five-fold symmetry which we
identified already as a torsion geometry anholonomy. From the association between torsion and
nonorientability presented in ⸹2, it is coherent to claim that topological anholonomities, i.e.
nonorientability would appear in microtubular conformations. We shall discuss below a Möbius strip
buckling pattern as a solitary wave arising from the nonlinear elasticity response of (nonorientable)
microtubules which would ensue from the coupling of tubulin to the anaesthetic factor.
The association of microtubules with a torsion geometry and nonorientability points to the
supradual Klein Bottle logic, in contrast to Hameroff and Watt’ s take that microtubules operate as
switching Boolean matrices processing binary bits states as they move through microtubules and
proteins associated to them [72]. Rather than Boolean matrices and further recalling the analogical
nature of the tubulin code, this points out to Matrix Logic, which has fuzzy logic, Boolean logic and
quantum logic for subcases. Matrix Logic is the matrix form of the Klein Bottle logic introduced by
August Stern, it is homologous to Quantum Mechanics for 2-state systems [265]. Rather than Matrix
Logic being circumscribed to logical operators these are jointly logical-quantum operators. Quantum
statements are interchangeably expressed as logical connections. It is noteworthy to recall that Orlov
showed that Quantum Mechanics can be derived from Boolean logic expressed as matrices ([179] ) . In
Matrix Logic invertible operators are also considered; their eigenvalues are not restricted to the real
numbers proper to measurements processes of quantum mechanical systems but may be complex
numbers. Indeed, these logical-quantum operators are not necessarily self-adjoint, the latter restriction
as in Quantum Mechanics for closed systems which is the case of Orlov’s rendering of Quantum
Mechanics from Boolean logic in matrix form. Non selfadjoint operators appear in the case of quantum
open system, say the cytoskeleton. First we discuss some crucial relations of this to Quantum
Information Theory.
11. The fundamental role of the Klein Bottle in Quantum Information theory and a theory of
consciousness
The Klein Bottle plays a core role in Quantum Information theory central to quantum computation,
through its 2x2 matrix representation (up to a scaling factor): the Hadamard matrix. This theory is
constructed from elementary quantum building blocks, namely qubits, rather than bits as the unit of
classical information, and logical gates. In quantum computation the gates are drawn from a universal
set of gates, namely, a set which can be used to perform general quantum computations (Nielsen &
Chang [174]). It is the Hadamard gate which supports transcending Boolean logic. In fact, in quantum
computation it is the single logical gate that transcends the computation of all Boolean functions through
the Toffoli reversible gate,which together with the Hadamard gate constitute a universal set of logical

gates (Aharonov [3]).Thus, they constitute the logical gates for which any possible operation on a
quantum computer can be expressed as a finite sequence of them. The notion that neuron microtubules
would support quantum computations has been raised by Hameroff and Penrose, yet they were mainly
concerned with microtubules as a Boolean gate architecture and the Hadamard gate was not considered
in their models [72-76,192]. This is quite remarkable since it is the Hadamard gate which may bring a
single qubit into a superposition state, the latter being the qubits which their theory of consciousness
deals with. Furthermore as already noted, the tubulin code is not dual logic.
12. Topological folding, nonlinear elasticity in the buckling of microtubules, memory and the
origin of life
Remarkably there is a close relation between the Möbius strip as a physical space topology and nonlinear
elasticity, which has been unnoticed by Penrose & Hameroff, which we turn to discuss. The phenomenon
of buckling of structures, say tubulin or microtubules, as in the Euler instability, does not correspond
to linear load induction but to a sudden instability due to a load of tubulin that may lead to the collapse
of the structure (de Pablo et.al. [297]). The response of an elastic Möbius strip to shear stresses is
intrinsically nonreciprocal and nonlinear, although the local stress-strain relation is linear. A direct
consequence of non-orientability is that no stress distribution can yield homogeneous shear
deformations over a Möbius strip. The topological anholonomity constrains the ribbon to remain
undeformed at one point whatever the magnitude of the applied stress. The associated buckling patterns
were found to propagate as solitary waves on a Möbius strip; this is a zero-energy cost process.
Furthermore the Möbius strip’s elasticity may support several conformations and posses a form of
mechanical memory as the static deformations encode their stress history. According to Bartolo &
Carpentier ([12]): “ Nonorientable surfaces offer a paradigmatic example of static mechanical memory.
Information is coded and stored by the temporal variations of the stress. Information is read measuring
the shear angle and deleted releasing the applied stresses”. Thus, for the elastic Möbius strip, the coding
of memory as stuff-stress reduces to a single variable, the shear angle: As in Occam’s Razor, the
principle of parsimony is the case. At this point we characterize that while memory might be stufflike
as it is embodied as nonorientable shape, most basically it is a function, very much alike consciousness
is (Solms [260]). Microtubules have a notorious involvement in learning and memory (Woolf [285]). In
this multistability of buckling patterns of elastic Möbius strips there is a common behaviour with regards
to the hybrid organic aromatic molecules which are present in the neuron, which may also assume
different shapes according to π-electron delocalization, leading to both orientable and nonorientable
conformations, to be discussed below.
In the mathematical formalization of cognition in the wake of Shepard’s Principle of
Complementarity, Leighton noted that memory cannot be formalized only in terms of symmetries and
the Erlangen Program. Indeed, in the investigation of the psychological relationship between shape and
time, Leyton argued compellingly that shape is used by the mind to recover the past and as such it forms
a basis for memory, for which Rapoport argued that torsion is the basis for any memorization (Leyton
[147]). Leyton identified a twist on a plane as the primal shape embodiment of memory. However, what
was left unmentioned by Leighton is that this primeval coding can further produce nonorientability,
establishing thus a permanence of the memory produced by the twisted folding of a plane, as noticed in
(Rapoport, [236]). In other words, the function of memory in producing shape is introduced by
nonorientability, embodied as shape, though it might not be notorious, just like consciousness is not
necessarily so. As for the role of memory in biological evolution and development, any development is
governed by the tension between the persistence of the past, and an anticipation of the future as proposed
in the Klein Bottle logophysics [225,229]. Similarly Stuart Kauffman proposed that in biology evolution
in the present is somewhat conditioned by the future future as possibility [295]. So any development is
governed by the tension between the persistence of the past, and an anticipation of the future. This points
out to Heidegger’s notion of time-space, time as a nonlinear shape operating as mediating past and future
through the present [298]. Where this shape of time-space is most notorious is in the experience of music
yet it also transpires in literature, the so called chronotopes of Bakhtin. One such chronotope is Dante’s
description of the trip to Hell in search of Beatrice, a Möbius strip journey (Bethea [314].)

To make further the case of topological folding and biology, they are the basis for the symbolic
meaning establishment of living organisms. On the one hand they are crucial to the morphomechanics
of the establishment of their bodyplans during development [232,233]. Furthermore they are crucial to
the symbol-matter complementarity of biological systems [257,312]. Pattee identified the relevance of
folding to the timing process crucial to metabolism [290]. Indeed, he described folding as operating to
transform the passive symbolic gene expressions into the dynamic rate control of enzymes. Pattee: “
Folding transforms what are essentially rate-independent syntactically coded sequences into ratedependent functional controls. Protein folding is a highly parallel process with so many degrees of
freedom that is difficult to model even on supercomputers”. Consequently, Rapoport followed by
identifying topological folding as the operation that turned the material world to the symbolic world of
organisms, the very origin of life [235]. As in the origin of life, the basis of consciousness is, in essence,
what we claim to be the case. Meaning would then have an origin, in the interplay of matter and symbols,
both for life in the first place and for consciousness, later for evolution, conceived in terms of folding
and palindromic sectors of genomes [233].
That this may apply to the elasticity of microtubules, actually to the transition of the awaken state
to the (partially) unconscious state as under anaesthetics, would be another proof of the homology of the
mathematical geometric-topological formalization of the physical world and that of the unconscious
modeling by the mind be that of the kinematic of objects or the “motions” arising in music perception
(Rapoport, [236]). This memory supports the mental modelization of the kinematics of regular and
irregular objects, by which an homology of the modelization of dynamics of point systems on spacetime
are interiorized as the mental modelization both in terms of torsion geometry. Already Shepard not only
discovered that the unconscious kinematical modelization required torsion geometries but also that
nonorientability came with it by terminating the twist with a topological identification, a memory
stabilization as already discussed. Furthermore Shepard discovered that “mental” rotations were
inherent to the cognition of music, as in the Tritone Paradox [251]. However he suggested that “mental”
rotations had no real substrate in the brain, say the neuronal dynamics. However, the nonlinear
dynamical systems modeling of motor activity, say of coupled oscillators, where behaviour is
represented as the strange attractors of this dynamics, disproved Shepard’s claim. Indeed, in the case of
polyrhythmic motor performance (Jagacinski et.al. [92]; Turvey [273]) and the rotational dynamics of
population of motor cells first discovered by Churchland (Lebedev et.al. [146]) their attractors are
nonorientable. Topological phases, retrieved.
13. Anaesthetics, the persistence of consciousness, the analogics of the tubulin code and
nonorientability in the topological chemistry paradigm and the multiconformation of aromatic
molecules
Hameroff came to collaborate with Penrose from his work in anesthesiology. He based his theoretization
on the evidence that upon administering anaesthetics to patients undergoing surgery, the evanescence of
the consciousness present at the awaken state holds as anaesthesia blocks consciousness and memory
while sparing non-conscious brain activities. Certainly most of the brain activity is beyond awareness
(Solms [259-262], Panksepp [182], Solms and Panksepp [126]). However, the previous description of
the anaesthetic state as a duality of awareness/unconscious-state is not the case. Particularly emotions
are not entirely suppressed in the anaesthetic state, the most common being anxiety, panic, helplessness,
etc (Gidron et.al. [65]). Dreams do not subside neither, being much alike dreams while sleeping, and
their experience appears to be unrelated to the depth of the anaesthetic state (Scheinen et.al. [247]).
Neither memory is inactive, uttered words and conversations can be registered and expressed after
recovery (Moerman et.al. [167]). The feeling of what happens may also be the case, in particular in neardeath-experiences (Lopez et.al. [150]). Since emotions are considered the primal form if not the very
source for consciousness as selfawareness further associated to hetero-reference -as the mimicry elicited
by the mirror neuron phenomenology (Rizzolatti et.al.[238]), the attribution of consciousness as
emerging from the physical process of the reduction of a quantum state under experience, say a
measurement, is left wanting. Indeed, it is hard to conceive this physicalist reductionism: It attributes to
this reduction to a single eigenstate the extraordinary physical source for consciousness of an agentindependent measurement what in fact is the emergence of an ampler selfawareness which already

emotions elicit, fundamentally as interoceptive, rather than exteroceptive as in the measurement process
discussed in physics. (Interoceptive homeostasic scanning regulation may involve measurements
operating in a Klein Bottle cybernetics [234]). Furthermore, under certain conditions this interoceptive
attention can be literally turned inside-òut, becoming a real world if not hyper-real, the focusing and
control of attention playing a crucial role (Laughlin et.al. [140-142]). Hameroff acknowledges this
problem and offers for possible explanation: “… abrupt transition from unconscious, or subconscious
possibilities to consciousness, and causal selection of particular actions and perceptions, may be seen as
“quantum state reduction,” or “collapse of the wavefunction” (Hameroff & Penrose [76]). In other
words, anaesthesia which elicits the “dark side of consciousness” -as Hameroff calls it- actually comes
with the need of showing that its “darkness” is not to be confused with “blackout”, at all. This is treating
by “normalizing” the situation: both the dark side of consciousness and its non complete evanescence
are all related to collapse of the wave function. We shall return to this below.
Remarkably all living molecules are susceptible to anaesthesia and plants are known to counter
stress by producing anaesthetics. Actually plants are capable of memory and display different forms of
intelligence (Trevawas [271] ).This may be prompted by the alterations introduced by anaesthetics to
the existing oscillatory modes in proteins which may tend to alter microtubule polymerization and
function. The organising behaviour of macromolecular entities, such as tubulin, indicates the existence
of a complex and very fast information processing activity. High -frequency neural oscillations have
been associated with conscious states, while low-frequency activity has been associated with
unconscious states (Cariani [30]). Coherence theories of anaesthesia suggest that general anaesthesia act
by disrupting coherent neuronal activity in critical brain structures. They do by preventing the protein
conformational changes which participate in the normal functioning of neurons [75,76] . In other words,
anaesthesia blocks the multiconformational states of molecules, only the one in action is preserved. Thus
it supresses at the level of the awaken state of awareness the supraduality operating these changes.
However, anaesthetics binding to tubulin in neurons disrupt the microtubules at their extreme or
sidewise, which otherwise they are stable for a lifetime, while for the other protein structures they are
susceptible to their intermittent assembling and disassembling (Karp [97]). The latter is naturally
conceived as the breakdown of microtubules by buckling, a core instability to nonlinear elasticity theory.
Given the importance of organic chemistry to the cytoskeletal dynamics which is upholded as basic
to the novel paradigm for the neurosciences proposed by Hameroff [76] in terms of aromatic
arrangements crucial to anaesthetics, it is important to observe that not only the usual Hückel 2-toruslike aromatics can be the case but rather there is an alternative Möbius strip-like aromatics, also called
Hückel- Möbius aromatics. In terms of molecular orbital theory these compounds have in common a
monocyclic array of molecular orbitals in which there is an odd number of out-of-phase overlaps, the
opposite pattern compared to the aromatic character of Hückel systems. The nodal plane of the orbitals,
viewed as a ribbon, is a Möbius strip, rather than a 2-torus, hence the name (Rainer [198)]. While
originally it was considered that Hückel- Möbius aromatics was unknown, in the last forty years starting
with the synthesis of Möbius strip shaped molecules, a host of such molecules have appeared and
furthermore the existence of multistable conformations transiting from nonorientability to orientability
and the converse. The nonorientability provides extra stabilization and with this molecules are less
reactive than those without this shape (see Janowicz [94]). The existence of multiple conformations as
stereoisomers lays at the very basis of Topological Chemistry (Mezey [118]), and the synthesis of
catenanes, rotaxanes, knotted molecules such as the Borromean ring, etc., of molecular motors in short,
for which Möbius strips may be used to that effect (Breault, [305]). This paradigm led to the bestowal
of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to J.P. Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart and B. Feringa.This coincided
with the 2016 bestowal of the Nobel Prize in Physics for the development of topological approach to
condensed matter physics and exotic matter to D. Thouless, F. Duncan, M. Haldane and J. Michael
Kosterlitz ([107])
We recall that hybridization is the concept used for explaining molecular shapes in the usual
approach, of mixing atomic orbitals into new hybrid orbitals (with different energies, shapes, etc. than
the component atomic orbitals) suitable for the pairing of electrons to form chemical bonds in valence
bond theory. As already mentioned, molecules may appear as having multiple conformations,
or a “split personality” in a colloquial dualistic description: on the one hand orientable conformations
29

may turn to be non-orientable, and the converse can also be the case (Rzepa [245]; Sokolov [258];
Stapien et.al. [263]). It is the hybrid orbitals which are considered to support the “split personality”
whereby, say graphene, coexists as in the normal and the Möbius strip configurations . Graphene is
considered to be a peculiar form of aromatic molecule (Popov et.al. [130]).This double configuration is
more generally encountered in aromatics which started with Kekule’s model of benzene, which is a case
of Hückel-Möbius aromatics as well as Hückel aromatics, i.e. the cyclic ring 2-torus shaped planar
molecules.
14. The topological chemistry paradigm and superposition in ORC OR theory
With respect to ORC OR the most basic example of multiple conformations and of the switching
between them, the “split personality” is that of tubulin itself: it leads to the quantum superposition from
which this theory departs from. Hameroff: “… since London forces are quantum mechanical, the
electron pair may occupy both states, and the protein exist in a quantum superposition of both open and
closed conformations. By going from bottom (quantum superposition) to top (one particular
conformation) the protein functions as a qubit” [76].
So, tubulins may operate as two different conformations upon coupling with a pair of quantum
coupled electrons in an internal hydrophobic pocket. Each tubulin may occupy two classical
conformations ( a “black”-open state and a “white”-closed state”), two classical bit states) or exist in
quantum superposition of both conformational states (a qubit). The former two states correspond to
Boolean states, the latter to a quantum superposition, typical of the Klein Bottle superposition as
nonorientable topology, lies at the very basis of ORC OR. We shall discuss this below.
Early in 1973 Sokolov reviewing the nascent paradigm of topological chemistry showed that a
modified form of the allosteric effect could be realised in molecules by an electron delocalization
mediated by Van der Waals-London forces which could be rendered as a change of electron density
shape with a migration of an electron as if a Klein Bottle outside/inside or inside/outside motion.
Sokolov proposed that the allosteric coupling of molecules rather than a lock-and-key coupling it
operates in terms of topological changes as discussed above. It is to be superseded by a dynamical shape
accommodation (Tripathi and Bankaitis [272]. Cosic and Cosic further identified resonant
electromagnetic energy transfer at specific frequency for the specific activation and interaction for
macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA as the crucial driving force for macromolecules
(protein, DNA and RNA) activation and interaction (Cosic & Cosic [39]). We already discussed
nonorientability supporting resonance, Hameroff recognized the importance of resonance as the main
interaction with the zero-point fluctuations (Penrose & Hameroff [75,76,192]) and electron
delocalization in the anaesthetic state and the phenomenon of consciousness (Hameroff et.al. [74]): He
observed that anaesthetic gas molecules act in hydrophobic (lipid-like, water-excluding) regions within
critical target proteins…by weak van der Waals London forces between the anaesthetic and nonpolar
amino acid groups (the same type of endogenous interactions occurring between non-polar amino acid
groups in the absence of anaesthetics)”. Furthermore “anaesthetics retard electron mobility—the
movement of free electrons in a corona… [B]y forming their own London force attractions in
hydrophobic pockets, anaesthetics may inhibit electron mobility required for protein dynamics, quantum
superposition and consciousness”. In other words, anaesthetics control by retarding or impeding the
electron delocalization that operate on aromatic molecules quintaessential to topological shaping and
the possible orientable to nonorientable reconformations. Nonanaesthetics may be understood as
occupying hydrophobic pockets without altering electron mobility, and convulsants as forming
cooperative van der Waals interactions, which promote excessive electron mobility and protein
dynamics in excitatory proteins.
We observed that biophotons emission could be produced due to change of conformation by reorganisation of chemical bonding, which is known in biology as chemiluminescence [225,229].
Furthermore, chemiluminescence is recognized to be the basic process for syntropic – rather than
entropic-organisation of organisms using stored energy of chemical machines, and that is the resonant
energy communication of quantum entanglement in organisms (Ho [79,80]). McClare argued that this
can produce using a chemical reaction a form for producing useful work. Namely a “molecular energy”
mechanism, which depends upon the rapidity of resonant energy-transfer (Mc Clare [160])

In ORC OR it is this quantum superposition which while in superposition, tubulins communicate/
compute with entangled tubulins in the same microtubule, and in other MTs in the same neuron.
Quantum states of tubulin/MTs are isolated/ protected from environmental decoherence by biological
mechanisms which are related to liquid crystals which may have nonorientable configurations, such as
phases of actin gelation, coherent water domains where the polar ordering produce a Möbius strip, and
alike tubulin they assemble and disassemble by absorption and emission of light, respectively, coherent
pumping and topological quantum error correction.
15. Consciousness states, warps, multiconformation molecules and anaesthetics, Klein Bottle
supraduality and Eastern Philosophy
The lingering question is: if after all, whatever the kind of states of consciousness are, under deep
anaesthesia or awaken, if in all cases the reduction to a single state is ascribed to the “source of
consciousness” what is the source for the differences between them? Would we consider anaesthesia as
a special case of induction of a blockage of the possibility of recognition of sensorial experience as if
arising from a given exterior world, together with the blockage of transforming this into action due to
the induced immovilization?
We are taken to contrast anaesthesia with the experience of sensory deprivation. Say, by immersion
into a lightless soundless ambience (incubation, as were known the long periods of sojourns in dark
caves (Kingsley [102] ) where motion was allowed, the ingestion of hallucinogens, or still the
submersion in a water tank with no further restrictions. What is reported in these situations is that rather
consciousness receding, fading or becoming impoverished, exactly the opposite is eventuated. Their
importance to the transformations of civilizations and human consciousness has been highlighted by
several scholars [102,103].
These transitional situations are called warps, and what warps elicit is a supradual logophysics. For
instance the hypnagogic warp from the waking phase to the dream phase of consciousness and the
inverse hypnopompic warp from the dream phase to the waking phase. Paraphrasing Benny Shanon, a
cognition psychologist who travelled across South America to experience entheogens for understanding
the psyche, what is elicited in these experiences is the “antipodes of the mind” being unified [248]. They
involve the autonomic nervous system (ANS) as it channels energy to the sensorium, and does so
through two systems considered complimentary: the excitation system and the relaxation system
(Gellhorn [57] Gellhorn and Kiely [58]). It is the combination of these systems and the evocation of
symbols what elicits the complexity of awareness as a cycle of meaning. This latter cycle also operates
in supradual terms (Rapoport [236]). With respect to anaesthetics (consciousness reduced) and
hallucinogens (consciousness enhanced), they act in opposite ways (Hameroff et.al., [74]), which we
shall discuss below.
Warps are conceived as “discrete phases, a phase cognized strip of unfolding experience
dominating for some time the sensorium, has a causal influence on the organisation of the phase
succeeding it, and a causal influence on the end of the phase preceding it” (Laughlin et.al. [142]) . Thus,
they are keenly related to memory, and they have an anticipative character, to the effect that perception
has an apperceptive nature: Prediction is involved in the selfreferential interoceptive homeostasic
regulation and related to a Bayesian inference process and the Markov blankets. We already discussed
their Klein Bottle topology.
Laughlin et.al.: “The awareness of experience involves cognition about self and world.
The root meaning of "awareness" is the same as "wary" and connotes careful attention to the world and
detection of danger. Because the definitive characteristic of awareness is recollection, remembering, or
recognition of patterns in experience, awareness obviously refers in part to a role
played by knowledge in experience. Further, since the recursive [my emphasis] quality of segments of
experience may be cognized as recurrent, awareness itself is organized into different "states" of
consciousness” (p.109; ibid.). So awareness is related to memory, and the selfreferential re-enactment
of its "contents". Thus if nonorientability would arise associated to the neuron cytoskeleton, then
memory as an inherent behaviour of these material structures would be embodied as nonorientability of
the cytoskeleton dynamical tensegrity structure. Upon collapse of such microtubules the Möbius strip
shaped soliton arising as the pattern produced by a nonorientable microtubule buckling would be the
31

memory in a zero-energy process [12]. Thus, through another warp it may in turn be evoked and in this
conception “a minimal reentrainment across warps is all that is required for integration of phases into
some semblance of a cognizable continuity” (Laughlin et.al., p.121 [142] ). The experiences reified by
warps do not "lie" in another branch of the universe as Penrose & Hameroff put it [75,76,192].
McGilchrist qualifies the latter invocation as the dominance of the either/or dual logic action proper to
the analytical function of the brain left hemisphere over the intuitive direct cognition holistic integration
by the right hemisphere [312].
From the topological chemistry paradigm. taking in account the already discussed Van der WaalsLondon forces operating the multistable topological shaping the research on both the reducedconsciousness anaesthetic states and the enhanced-consciousness-psychedelic states, say Ayahuasca,
LSD, DMT (Dimethyltryptamine), we can phrase it like Hameroff et.al. which spell it out in terms of
dependences rather than associations [74]. The different states of consciousness as elicited both by the
anaesthetic and psychedelic states appear to be related “to quantum processes in hydrophobic pockets.
Furthermore these quantum processes are inhibited by anaesthetics which impair electron mobility in
van der Waals London forces”, i.e. related to the metamorphical condition of aromatic
multiconformations. Further: “The same processes are enhanced (hallucinations, but also
enlightenment) in the presence of psychedelic drugs, those with indole rings donating electron resonance
energy to indole rings in tryptophan within the hydrophobic pocket, forming a collective quantum state.
Consciousness depends on quantum states of electrons within hydrophobic pockets in a class of brain
proteins”. In other words, as already stated anaesthetics block the quantum processes and computations
-which ultimately depend on the Klein Bottle-Hadamard operator- by constraining the electron
delocalization and thus multiconformation metamorphical topological transformation. In distinction
with the latter, the altered-enhanced-consciousness states induced by psychedelic conformations or
meditative techniques appear to enhance electron delocalization towards the formation of coherent
collective states. Thus they induce a metamorphical supradual logophysics of multiconformation
topological transformations proper to the two versions of aromatic molecules. One of these enhanced
yet seemingly rare state is called in the Eastern traditions by different names: Nirvana, Satori, Turiya,
perhaps others we are not informed of.
Notably, the shamanistic and Shinto roots of Japanese culture, and the later inception of Zen
Buddhism have known and continue to practice meditational states. They allow for the first-person
account of consciousness which is mostly decried by science as falling into the figments of our
imagination, a practice which anyway has been and continues to be the hallmark of the curiosity and
enthusiasm of the human condition. They procure to achieve the state of “supreme unification”, which
has the supradual logophysics at its core. Hagiwara: “the work of the Japanese Zen master Hakuin
[Hakuin Ekaku (白隠 慧鶴 1685-1768) ] utilized the idea of the Möbius strip (and the similarly
paradoxical Klein bottle) in his expression of satori (nirvana). …a crucial visual expression of both
Hakuin’s satori and the Buddhist Dharma (Law)” (Hagiwara [71]). In the Indian Advaita Vedånta
philosophy there is a fourth state of consciousness other than the three states of awakeness, dream-filled
sleep and deep sleep: beyond deep sleep, Turiya. It is discussed in Verse 7 of the Mandukya Upanishad
[178]:
“Not inwardly cognitive, nor outwardly cognitive, not both-wise cognitive, not a cognition-mass,
not cognitive, not non-cognitive, unseen, with which there can be no dealing, ungraspable, having no
distinctive mark, non-thinkable, that cannot be designated, the essence of assurance, of which is the state
of being one with the Self the cessation of development, tranquil, benign, without a second, such they
think is the fourth. He is the Self (Atman). He should be discerned” (Olivelle).
Hence, Turiya is transcendent and immanent, the metaform for cognition and perception, the
metaform for both pattern formation and recognition, yet neither Outside-Outside nor Inside-Inside,
neither Inside-Outside and Outside-Inside (“nor even both together”); beyond perception, invisible,
ungraspable and without distinctions, and still supports all the other states of consciousness, the Klein
Bottle.
To resume this section: prompting consciousness as related to microtubule dynamics primarily
elicited through anaesthetics has brought us to examine states of consciousness other than the awaken

state. They appear to indicate a supradual logophysics where memory is highlighted as a primary
function. This will be discussed in terms of microtubule dynamics and buckling patterns below.
17. The topological chemistry paradigm and the origin of life and meaning.
Returning to the supraduality that the multiple “split personality”conformations embody, this is relevant
in regards to biosemiotics and the characterization of life as related to artifact-making, for which
molecular motors -particularly the cytoskeletal protein motors- and DNA may play the role of
paradigmatic examples. According to biosemiotician Barbieri this is setup in terms of the Inside/Outside
categorical divide and still in the alledgedly linear character of the geometry of the biological digital
codes, and its digital character. Barbieri: “…molecular biology has discovered that the production of
genes and proteins requires not only catalysts but also templates. The catalysts join the subunits together
by chemical bonds, and the templates provide the order in which the subunits are assembled. It is
precisely that order that determines biological specificity, the most important characteristic of life, and
that order comes from a molecule that is outside the assembled molecule. This is precisely the
characteristic that divides spontaneous objects from artifacts. In spontaneous and in catalyzed processes,
the order of the components comes from within the molecules, i.e., is determined by internal factors,
whereas in genes and proteins it comes from without, from an external template” ([318], p.11) :
Actually it was biosemiotician Hoffmeyer who first suggested that life appeared as a lipid
membrane surface produced an Inside and Outside in an asymmetric relation vis-à-vis an autocatalytic
system of compounds, namely the elements of the cytoskeleton and water (see Rapoport [232]). Its
protoconsciouness described as “the never-ending interest of the insides into their outsides or, in other
words, cellular aboutness [the term introduced by philosopher Brentano, considered by
phenomenological philosophy as a protoform of consciousness]...this “interest” should be understood
as a property that ultimately was derived from the primordial membrane itself”.
However, as we have just seen and it turned out to be the case of genomes, rather than linearity we
have that Nature introduces memory through the torsion encoded as nonorientability and develops its
genomic codification in palindromic sequences related to nonlinear non-orientable surfaces, and the
digital character of the codifications is derived from the Klein Bottle logic [234]; we shall later discuss
the possibility of reconstructing the continuous signal by adequate data sampling of a discrete series.
Furthermore, what chemical topology has shown is that these molecular motors can be synthetized from
the application of Möbius-like twists that anticipate life, so that Barbieri’s account appears to be
amenable to be understood in terms of the non-orientable surfaces of self-reference, rather than requiring
an elaborate distinction between life and non-life as discussed in (Rapoport, [230]): The dualistic
ontology cannot actually integrate what it fractured, ab initio. We have already discussed the semiotic
sign-processes origin of life and memory, as well as the interpretation of codes in terms of topological
nonorientable folding. If life is identified as artifact-making, clearly chemical topology shows that this
is unprecise –or still, ontologically mistaken- with regards to the actual non-dual ontology and
logophysics that operates as an ontopoiesis, the supradual logos as the source of creativity (Rapoport,
[230]). The semiotic agency that develops as complex structures required for life exist in the chemical
domain in terms of non-orientability while in biology the multisystem integration of an organism
requires an overall control which penetrates in the particular subsystems and selforganises Klein Bottle
wise (Neumann [ 173] ; Rapoport [234] ). Chemical topology dispels the claim of a divide between the
“analogue world of chemistry and the digital world of life.” Still, instead of envisaging the
Interior/Exterior duality, the interplay of templates, genes, proteins and catalysts is
to be understood in terms of a HyperKlein Bottle cybernetics [230 -234,236].
Examining the development of structure and tissue differentiation in cells, it was found to be
mediated by an active cytoskeleton propagating alike light ways in terms of the Fermat Principle
(Gordon [13]). We proposed that the cytoskeleton as a tensegrity has a physical support on optical
vortical electromagnetic or sound waves network operating as emmiting and absorbing antennas, with
nonorientable polarizations interacting with the coherent liquid crystal nonorientable topology of the
intracellular coherent water domains (Rapoport [225,229]). Remarkably, Hameroff has proposed that
acupuncture practiced in Traditional Chinese Medicine may be related to holography having
microtubules operating as tuned resonators carrying electromagnetic pulses which by either stimulating

33

or relaxation with a needle applied to the upper epidermis induce membrane ion currents to the effect of
reaching a state of homeostasis . (He further suggested that Chi, the Chinese energy field would be
coherent photic energy from the Sun and stars which is refracted by the upper epidermis (stratum
corneum) further resonating with the microtubules network). We shall further discuss the notion of
microtubules as electronic resonator devices and antennas.
18. Cytoskeletal dynamics, morpho-logic, topological phases and nonorientabiity
A coherent network is not exclusive to the brain-mind, genomes with their dynamical nonorientable
dynamics resonating with electromagnetic and sound vortices with nonorientable phases or amplitudes,
respectively, as if a coordinated orchestra of resonant topological phases. This tensegrity is the basis
for a supradual logophysics rather than a dual-logophysics (Rapoport [225,229]). In cellular cytoplasm
tensegrity structures are basically produced in terms of geodesic paths which continuously absorbproduce tension, so they are considered in terms of elastodynamics (Gordon [132]), though
electromagnetic fields with eikonal light rays propagation can also be a natural interpretation; they
develop topological anholonomities (Bliokh et.al. [21]). These differentiation waves support tissue
differentiation and meiosis [225,229]. Since the wavefront propagation of gravitational and
electromagnetic waves (light rays under the eikonal condition) in matter coincide as proved by Fock in
his theory of gravitation [53 ] , and the latter coincide with the wavefront sets of elastodynamics (Bóna
and Slawinski [23] ), as wavefronts define the main morphological features, the actual physical content
is, in general principles, secondary. In principle, either the gravitational, electromagnetic and
elastodynamical interpretations are undiscernible morphological-wise. Actually, whatever the
interpretation of the physical nature of the waves might be, as long as is consistent with the stuff of the
object , environmental interrelations and the morphologies, they are methodologically valid. Certainly,
it is hard to conceive the empirical possibility of discerning which is the case.
However, recent experimental settings have allowed to show the filaments deep inside the neural
branches check the potential difference across the junctions by sending and receiving electromagnetic
signals (Ghosh et.al. [64]; Agrawal et.al. [133], Singh et.al. [254-256]). Filaments and four ordered
structures inside a neuron fire a thousand times faster than the ionic current. Filamentary
communication is less known to the ionic signal transmission whereas the two are intimately linked
through time domains. Novel scanning methods were introduced by the Hindu group, dielectric
resonance microscopy (DRM), to operate in two-time domains, milliseconds and microseconds
simultaneously, for the first time. It was found that four ordered structures in the cytoskeletal filaments
exchange energy ~250 µs before a neuron fires, editing spike-time-gap—key to the brain's cognition.
Also the control of the neuron process was achieved, either by deterring from firing above a threshold
or initiating a fire by wirelessly pumping electromagnetic signals. The experimental discoveries
“support a new dielectric resonator model of neuron functioning in various time domains, thus
suggesting the dynamic anatomy of electrical activity as information-rich!”. Furthermore, a
fundamental aspect that has been elicited by the resonator frequencies is that the cytoskeleton operates
as a fractal architecture of triplets conformed by triplets supporting quantum topological phases. While
tubulin and microtubules are effective insulators with low conductance upon applying to them an
alternating electric current at specific “resonant” frequencies, their conductance become extremely high
and microtubules excellent conductors. Excitation at these resonant frequencies causes microtubules to
assemble extremely rapidly; Fröhlich-type condensation is invoked to describe them [56,151].
Remarkably the same superconductive-like behaviour is the case of Möbius strip electronic resonator
devices and antennas to be discussed below.These resonant frequencies show selfsimilar conductance
patterns repeating every 3 or so orders of magnitude, over 15 orders of magnitude in the brain, from the
quantum world to the electro-encephalogram (“EEG”). From terahertz through gigahertz, megahertz,
kilohertz and hertz, conductance at each of these frequencies showed self-similar “triplet-of-triplets”
resonance patterns
To resume, there is more to the neurons that ion transport: Indeed, that there is a subcellular
cytoskeletal phenomenology to neurons which is subjacent to the process of polarization of neurons and
their ensuing depolarization. This cytoskeletal behaviour is continuous, wavelike and thus neurons are
conceived as continuous dynamical systems, described by nonlinear differential equations, for which
34

their stability and the asymptotic state known as attractors are crucial. However, rather than perception
being continuous or discrete, exclusive or which is the case of dual Boolean logic, the Klein Bottle
logophysics integrates both. We have discussed this already in terms of the warps transitions of
awareness states. Notably in morphological terms the abrupt nondifferentiable form of a spike as a wave
is a point singularity, i.e. formless, which according to the current paradigm further propagates on the
neuron membrane. In other words, since this signal is formless, it cannot generate in-formation as
morphogenesis. It stands for the “it out of bit” digital dual-logophysics proposed by Wheeler (see
Rapoport [234,236], Floridi [52]). In the terms of semiotics for which signs are architectonical
organisation of packets of energy (Taborsky [267]) the singular dotlike packet of the spike as a
morphless architecture cannot elicit any meaning at all, it bears no in-formation, no induction of
morphology! Actually the identification of topological folding together with a membrane as precursor
of life was in terms of folding being a semiotical meaning-conveyor sign as expounded by Hoffmeyer.
As the neuronal action potentials are the primal signs of the brain-mind, be that in its preponderantly
unconscious operation and its selfawareness mode, the process of meaning assignment cannot be
generated nor sustained by a pointlike formless signal. The attribution of a non-differentiable Diracdelta like ion-based spike has been brought into empirical examination, departing from the notion that
there is much more to the neuronal behaviour the ion currents which is based in the continuous so-called
subthreshold phenomenology.
19. Nonorientability and the discrete optimal representation of continuous signals: The
topographic maps of the sensorium as a discrete sampling reconstruction of a continuous signal
The dual-logic spike paradigm conceives the number of spikes as the discrete variable for a “neural
coding” such that objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of
spikes. But the pointlike nature of spikes in this paradigm cannot support any meaning at all, as already
discussed. Moreover, the details of the cytoskeletal phenomenology have been obliterated although they
support the behaviour of the neuron. In contradistinction perceptual systems construe models
introjecting from relations between sensory signals and actions, which are subjected to constraints which
determine the outcome of the underlying physical and chemical laws, which have a nonorientable
topology for signature. In the visual and somatosensory systems their topographic representation of
periphery-to-cortex-to-periphery relations conform a Klein Bottle logophysics as elicited by Werner
&Whitsel for the somatosensory system [119,281]. Neurons in the hippocampus represent the rat’s
position mapping (Mac Naughton et.al. [161,162]) producing a Möbius strip (Rapoport, [236]).
Brette: “Neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured and therefore
unable to represent relations…The coding metaphor [following Shannon’s statistical theory of
communication wrongly deemed information-wise] tries to fit the dynamic, circular [selfreferential
Klein Bottle-wise], and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations
between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent” [26].
Indeed, nonlinearity is incongruent with discreteness, unless we represent the former as a discrete
representation of a continuous signal whose maximal frequency, 𝑓𝑚𝑎𝑥 is incorporated into a sample
rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time
signal of finite bandwidth. This is guaranteed by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem in the field
of signal processing [157]. It serves as a fundamental bridge between continuous time signals and
discrete-time signal processing. Indeed, if the continuous signal has a maximal frequency, say 𝑓𝑚𝑎𝑥 a
sufficient sample-rate processing is therefore anything larger than 2𝑓𝑚𝑎𝑥 . Equivalently, for a given
sample rate 𝑓𝑠 perfect reconstruction is guaranteed possible for a bandlimit less than half the sample
rate.
We can consider this duplication, the 2:1 harmonics, as a representation of a continuous signal
performed on a non-orientable Möbius strip or a Klein Bottle with length 2𝑓𝑚𝑎𝑥 , on which we take
samples distributed on it that exceed its length. They need not be distributed homogeneously.
Whether the nature of perception is discrete or continuous is unsettled (van Rullen & Koch [137]).
Brain function involves oscillations at various frequencies. This could imply that perception and
cognition operate periodically, as a succession of cycles mirroring the underlying oscillations. In the
case of EEGs we already saw that they operate as a system of 2:1 harmonics conceivable as overlayed

Möbius strips with cross-interaction. Also, the cytoskeleton appears to be organized as a fractal
organisation with specific frequencies which appear to organize as chronomes, time structures (Rapoport
[226]).
Contrary to earlier views of discrete perception as a unitary sampling rhythm, contemporary
evidence points not to one but several rhythms of perception. Would we consider the discrete case, then
it is in principle possible to construe a representation of it as if a continuous signal, optimally, by the
previous prescription and the metaform of such construal is again, a Möbius surface, as if the continuous
model would be the original signal.
This reconstitution by considering the sampled discrete signal as if disposed on a Möbius strip or
a Klein Bottle -the 2:1 harmonic being also the case- leads us to consider the Klein Bottle topologies of
the visual and somatosensory topographies as such general reconstruction process. In this process the
Fourier transform plays the crucial role (see Pribram [125,196]; de Valois [306]) that already the Klein
Bottle invariance of the phase of the cortical receptive fields shows that the Klein Bottle as metaform of
pattern formation and pattern recognition would be preserved along the reconstruction process. In the
contrary perception and cognition would be impossible.
20. Morphology of spikes as revealed by resonance and topological anholonomities
Returning to morphology as the natural analogical codification as in-formation, shape supporting
meaning, spikes could not be pointlike. Such a singular signal to be transmitted along an axon, would
not survive, it would dissipate instantaneously (Ghosh et.al. [64]). An actual form is required to this
effect, “the spike should have the appearance of a ring, encompassing the diameter of a cylindrical axon
or dendron…” (Ghosh et.al.., [64])). In other words, the form of the sign should somewhat be
accommodated by the architecture which supports the sign as its transmission, in this case a cylinder,
the form of the axon or dendrite, as an electrical circuit the connecting “wires” of the neuronal
architecture. The suggested form actually observed is a ring, moving pairwise: two confronting rings;
see fig.1 in [64]. Furthermore, they are associated to a 3D electric field, which in homogeneous media
appear as Möbius strip polarizations transversal to the propagation of the field.
Bandyopadhyay and collaborators used nanotechnology at ambient temperatures to measure
quantum resonance conduction in microtubules as a function of applied alternating current frequency.
They found self-similar conductance patterns at specific frequencies every few orders of magnitude,
i.e., in terahertz, gigahertz, megahertz, and kilohertz, equivalent to the 10−4 seconds. These results also
were claimed by Hameroff & Penrose to confirm the ORC OR theory.
Action potentials and the cytoskeleton, protein and microtubule morphogenesis of the living brain
appear to selforganise as topologies associated to Berry phases related to resonances of vortical
dynamics (Bandyopadhyay [14]). They pertain to an intricate cellular tensegrity architecture which
responds to alternate currents resonating in ranges which reach terahertz values. This confirmed the
hypothesis that neurons are resonators in which the complex architecture of the subcellular level
resonate to a now identified spectra of frequencies. Each resonant frequency produces a phase shift:
“while passing through a microtubule nanowire, the ac signal shifts its phase by nπ=4, (n = 0,1,2 . . .).
The sum of phase shifts for a set of resonance frequencies forming a group is 360°, so completing a
phase cycle is not incidental” (Ghosh et.al., [64]). Indeed, 360° is the topological (an)holonomy of the
Möbius strip, as already shown. Rather than action potentials being morphless, points, the Hindu group
was able to identify them as pairs of luminous annular shapes, two electromagnetic optical vortices
sitting above the terminating dendrites. The nonorientability suggested by these empirical findings of
luminous structures point to characterize each of them as a "solid" Möbius strip, the pinched-torus Klein
Bottle. Remarkably it appears in the modelization of visualization by the moving subject while watching
a distant moving point, the so called parallax vision, to be presented elsewhere by the present author
(see https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pinched_Torus_Klein_bottle.jpg).
21. Classical-quantum resonator devices as metaphors of the neuron cytoskeletal architecture
We return to the discussion of nonorientability supporting boson-fermion systems. This is generic as
can be seen in 1d and 2d electronic and microwave devices, a special class of transmission lines of finite

extent with well defined boundary conditions such as coupled resonators systems embedded on a
Möbius strip. As a proof of concept, on producing such a nonorientable embedding of a linear system
turns to behave like an infinite yet compact transmission line with remarkable superconductive-like
behaviour. These systems are low-pass filters with remarkable superconductive properties. They have
been used to design antennas, magnetic resonance and nanodevices, since they allow for efficient
compact packing producing an infinite transmission line with half the resonance frequency of the
original untorsioned line (Pond [194,195], Rodhe et.al. [239]). They enable, in principle, a Tesla Coil
for global wireless transmission of electricity and high-temperature superconductors.They give rise to
boson-fermion symmetries, where the non-orientable 4π symmetry are formal patterns of annular
resonators with the 2π symmetries (Ballon [11], Hamilton et.al. [77]): Spinor fields arising with 2d
devices.
Together with the findings of the Hindu group, this suggests that the cytoskeletal neuron
architecture, conceptually at least, can be conceived as a recursive architecture of resonators which may
functionally operate alternating in the nonorientable and annular ring forms: This is an alternative to
Hameroff & Penrose ORC OR theory to be discussed below. A resonator fractal architecture turned
indeed to be the case though nonorientability was not mentioned at all [14], nor by them.
This differs with the quantum reductionism of Hameroff & Penrose who try to anchor
consciousness in a rather remarkable superposition, on the one hand the microtubule structures of the
cytoskeletal neuronal structures -which we extensively showed to be anchored in a supradual
logophysics- and on the other an unknown “quantum gravitation”, which these authors invoke as a
metaphor for a model which we describe below. They further invoke the neuron dual fire/non-fire
paradigm while they focus their attention on the subthreshold cytoskeleton continuous phenomenology
of integrate-and-fire neurons where the resonator character of neurons is central and related to a
supradual principle. They invoke the findings by the Hindu group on the multifrequency resonant
behaviour of the elements of the neuron cytoskeleton as supporting evidence of their ORC OR theory.
Remarkably they refrain from mentioning the vortical structures and the topological phases arising in
physics and revealed by this group in their investigations of the action potentials arising from the
subthreshold cytoskeleton phenomenology. They chose to posit the appearance of consciousness as
arising from the decoherence of the purported quantum mechanical phenomenology which they refer to
massive particles which somehow alter the coherence of the quantum fluctuations to produce the actual
world of experience, one of the many branched world of possible states, consciousness the emergent
agency. For them the collapse of the wave function is an agency-independent physical phenomenon,
thus the “objective reduction” (OR) qualification, which further “provides the bridge between quantum
and classical physics". They depart from extending the Schroedinger equation modified by random
terms associated to quantum fluctuations, which somehow are resolved into decoherence by the
microtubules.
That quantum physics is indeed the case is evidently associated to the electromagnetic character
of the action potentials. We recall that Dirac’s equation of relativistic quantum mechanics, both the
linear and nonlinear forms, for a Dirac-Hestenes spinor field, and Maxwell equation -as a single
equation- for the electromagnetic field, as written in a Clifford bundle, are equivalent, under the proviso
of a rotation on the 2d spin-plane [207,208,217]. The latter is not necessarily a 2d-plane, but in principle
can be a nonorientable Möbius strip as arises in optical vortices with nonorientable polarizations (Bauer
et.al., [17], Bliokh et.al. [21], Freund [54]).
22. Supradual Klein Bottle logophysics, quantum cognition and Matrix Logic
We already discussed the nondual analogic of the tubulin code.The topological phases emerging from
the resonant subthreshold phenomenology appears as a supradual logophysics related to the elementary
brain phenomenon, which also is the case of cognition and the unconscious modeling by the brain-mind
of object-kinematics and the perception of music. Action potentials rather than morphless
nondifferentiable spikes are pairs of electromagnetic annular-like optical vortices related to topological
phases.

We propose otherwise, incorporating the supradual logophysics of the subthreshold
phenomenology, which is supported by topological phases and the quantum-mechanical-likeness of the
mind, in the sense considered by Quantum Cognition, to be discussed below.
Neuropsychologist cum anthropologist Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum proved that macroscopic
entanglement of minds is the case particularly when strong emotions are involved, as elicited in pair of
lovers undergoing meditation [68,69]. So the quantum-likeness of the brain is not to be looked upon as
exclusively brainwise.
This leads us to topological entanglement, the Klein Bottle. The non-Boolean logic of the mind,
operating inferentially, deductively and memorywise -the inversion of operators for backtracking
cognitive state- is indeed noncommutative: the Matrix Logic based on the Klein Bottle, after August
Stern [265]. In the former, the mind operators as 2x2 matrices operating on cognitive bra-ket states as
vectors on a plane. These operators may be invertible and in distinction with the standard physical
quantum operators they may be non-hermitean, so real eigenvalues proper of measurement of physical
processes are superseded by complex values. They can be written as quantum field creation and
annihilation operators, and some are nilpotent, non trivial square roots of the null operator. Particularly
they arise as quaternionic light rays giving rise to torsion fields with 3d polarizations represented as
Penrose’s twistors (Rapoport, [223,220,226]).
The most fundamental noncommutativity in this logic is that TRUE and FALSE operators are
noncommutative. This introduces a torsion given by the commutator, which we shall denote as M,
[TRUE,FALSE] = TRUE . FALSE – FALSE . TRUE = TRUE – FALSE = M.
The dots in the first identity stand for matrix multiplication. M is the fundamental operator of Matrix
Logic. Nonlinear multiplication is turned to additive structure in the third expression. M is nilpotent,
M 2 = 0. This commutator, i.e. M = TRUE – FALSE, is the fifth side of the pentagon given by TRUE
and FALSE for the other sides of a dislocated parallelogram, alike u and v in Fig.2. Here TRUE =
1 1
0 0
). Both TRUE and FALSE are idempotent, i.e. TRUE 2 = TRUE and FALSE 2 =
), FALSE = (
(
0 0
1 1
FALSE, and so they stand for projection operators.
In addition to the previous antisymmetric form, we have a symmetric form, which together with
M becom the two fundamental cognitive operators of Matrix Logic. It is
{TRUE, FALSE} =TRUE . FALSE + FALSE. TRUE = FALSE + TRUE.
In M we find the two possible orientations, plus 1 and minus 1, superposed as either the Möbius
strip or Klein Bottle. Matrix Logic is isomorphic to 2-state Quantum Mechanics. Alike Lie groups as
torsion manifolds where the commutator of the elements of the Lie algebra yields the structure
coefficients, the torsion tensor, the torsion of cognitive space appears as a non-null commutator. The
five-fold symmetry of cognitive space. The importance of this lack of commutativity cannot be
overstressed: it introduces the notion of a cognitive operator associated to this topological superposition
-vis. nonorientability, a logical derivative and topological charge associated to cognitive loops. This is
the domain of the mind, for which knots and their tying and untying are fundamental. Rather than this
being separated from the geometry of the mind, which is torsion, they are united. We recall that the
brain is qualified as a geometric “engine”, referring to the visual system and its ecological integration.
However as visual cognition working through projectivity, as introduced by the Renaissance Masters,
is integrated to the mind by antipodal topological identification which produces a Möbius strip, from
which selfhood arises unconsciously [236]. This is also the case of the hippocampal spatial mapping of
the environment by rats, as elicited by Moser & Moser with the Norwegian University of Science and
Technology neuroscience group (Mc Naughton et.al. [161,162]). It also is the case of the unconscious
modeling of the kinematics of objects, or still the cognition of music, as elicited by the Principle of
Complementarity of cognitive psychology. Remarkably, in the quantum reductionism that aims to
anchor consciousness as emerging from Quantum Mechanics, the topological nature of the mind’s
operations and its relation to torsion are unconsidered altogether. Yet as introduced in this article, it is

in the nonorientable and the torsion primal anholonomities where this logophysical fusion of the mind
and the physical -in the ample sense- domains operate in the construal of experience. This further
extends to the seemingly abstract topological phases, which are no less “real” than the case of physical
space or spacetime, say the Aharonov-Bohm phenomenon, which actually is a trace-torsion differential
1-form. Topological charges is the case of the hypercolumnar architecture of the primal visual cortex
and its Klein Bottle topology. It is also the case of condensed matter physics and particularly liquid
crystals, the matter of which the brain is made of, and genomes too where nonorientability is eminent
in its palindromic sectors (Rapoport [233]).
23. The unbroken information phase as nonorientable topology, Matrix Logic and Quantum
Mechanics, the nonorientable topological form of coherence/decoherence cycle and
holography
In Matrix Logic information is considered as something physically real, no different that space and
time, with thinking as its manifestation [265,220,230-236]. In classical physics we resort to classical
probability and real numbers. In quantum physics complex numbers are required to describe probability
amplitudes and phases, real and imaginary components respectively. But the mind-brain is neither
quantum nor classical, but a distinct phase, its “matter” is information, as form-inducing
(which we called in-formation) and as data which anyway have a form [31,32,231-234]: the information
phase. This requires for its description the so called denktors, thinking states, which use both complex
probabilities and amplitudes. However, as is the case of the topological paradigm of physics as appears
in condensed and soft matter physics, Matrix Logic deals with topological charges, as already the
pinwheel architecture of the primal visual system shows to be the case, i.e. the very periodic architecture
of the visual cortex, whose topology is the Klein Bottle. The information phase appears as a transition
from orientability to nonorientability, as already the unconscious modelling of the kinematics of objects
or music cognition requires: a torsion on a plane further glued as the very basis for the appearance of
memory as discussed before relative to the Complementary Principle of cognitive psychology. Or still,
the appearance of memory of buckling patterns of nonlinear elasticity in microtubules. Upon performing
the twist and further stabilizing by the topological identification of the sides of a priorly orientable
surface the information phase is constituted. It is free of constraints as imposed by relativistic
consideration. All points or events in the priorly bilateral surface become united independently of
distance be that of space or time: a topological form of holism and holography as well. We already
described though non-formally the relation between the Klein Bottle, i.e, the information phase on the
one hand and classical logic as arises in classical physics, say with the validity of Newton’s Third Law.
We also indicated the primal role of the in-formation phase-Klein Bottle- in producing the classical dual
logophysics, i.e. the phase of classical physics in terms of the principles of dual logic, and the further
reconstitution of the former from the latter in a selfreferential cycle. This begs for the reformulation of
the discussions on the classical world as the topological decoherence of the information phase.
In Matrix Logic logophysical operators, L, act on bra states ˂𝑞| = (𝑞̅ 𝑞) and kets |q> = (𝑞̅ 𝑞)𝑡𝑟 ,
L|q> with 𝑞̅ + q= 1. Thus, TRUE| q> = |1>, FALSE |q> = |0>, with |0˃ = (1 0)𝑡𝑟 and |1˃= (0 1)𝑡𝑟 , the
true and false states.The scalar true and false values of dual Boolean logic correspond to the eigenvalues
of these operators. They are orthogonal. Further consider the orthogonal quantum basis: |𝑆+ ˃ = (1 1)𝑡𝑟
and |𝑆− ˃= (1 − 1)𝑡𝑟 , so that ˂0|1˃= 0, ˂𝑆+ |𝑆−˃= 0.
These two states can be thought of arising from a surface given by a closed oriented band
projecting on the xy plane. Thus to each side of the surface we can associate its normal unit vectors,
(1 0) and (0 1). Suppose that we now cut this surface and introduce a twist on the band and we glue it to
get thus a Möbius surface. We recall that this is what in cognitive psychology led to identify the genesis
of memory, up to the topological identification, as discussed before. Now the surface has lost its
orientability and we can identify one side with the other, so that we can generate the superpositions |𝑆+ ˃
and 𝑆− ˃. Remarkably, these states are related by a change of phase, namely a rotation of 90 degrees.
What the twisting and loss of orientability produced, can be equivalently understood by the fact that
TRUE and FALSE are no longer as in Boolean logic and the Aristotelian propositional frame. Indeed,
they are no longer dual and what matters is their difference, which in the case of scalar truth values does

39

IARD 2022

not exist. The other state also can be interpreted as a state that represents the fact that the states as
represented by vectors, have components standing for truth and falsity values which are independent,
so that the Aristotelian link that makes one the trivial reflexive value of the other one is no longer
present: they each have a value of their own. The situation is radically different to Aristotelian-Boolean
logic in that now (0 0) is another state, ‘false and true’. This is the situation of ‘Schroedinger’s cat’ and
the Liar Paradox; they are topologically embodied. This state together with (1 1) , ’nor false nor true’
state together with (0 1), true, and (1 0) false states we have a 4-state logic in which the logical
connectives have been promoted to operators. We have thus returned to Nagarjuna’s four-loci logic, the
Hindu philosopher who for some reason -seemingly unclarified- called Aristotelian logic the ‘student’s
logic’ [299].
We have the expressions
|0˃ = (|𝑆+ ˃ + |𝑆− ˃)/2 and |1˃= (|𝑆+ ˃ - |𝑆− ˃)/2, and
|𝑆+ ˃ = 0˃ + |1˃, |𝑆− ˃= |0˃- |1˃.

In other words, the classical states are the equally weighted signed superposition states, which
themselves are the equal weighted signed Boolean states. While the classical states are ½ weighted the
superposition states are not, though we can introduce the normalization factor 1/√2. Describing the
1 1
) we obtain:
unbroken topological phase by the Hadamard 2x2 matrix H= (
1 −1
H|0˃ = |𝑆+ ˃ and H|1 ˃ = ||𝑆− ˃,

thus transforming the classical states into superposed states. In the state of true and false coordinates,
the action of H on 0˃ rotated it by 45° , while the action of H on |1˃ flipped it. Reversing the previous,
we still operate with H but halved, so that
½ H|𝑆+ ˃ = |0˃ and ½ H|𝑆−. ˃ = |1˃,

thus transforming the superposed states into the classical states. It is possible still to make the system
unitary by normalizing by dividing by √2. To resume, through topological transformation tantamount
to introduce nonorientability we can transform the classical eigenstates basis to the quantum states basis
thus completing a selfreferential cycle upon doing this. Both complete basis of eigenstates are
functionally complete and mutually spanning. We also have the decomposition of M = |𝑆+ ˃ < 𝑆− |.
We recall that the Hadamard operator is the gate that allows transcending classical Boolean
computations. The fact that it is also the interface between the quantum and classical states indicates the
supradual primality on the brain-mind. In Matrix Logic quantum (for spin-up and spin-down states)
and cognitive identities can be related interchangeably, through a spin logophysical operator,σ, which
is a symmetric term of M. The decomposition is M = TIME + σ, TIME being symmetric and unitary,
and σ = 𝜎𝑧 the Pauli matrix. This link is a logophysical interface between the quantum and informational realms, in which topology, torsion, logic and the quantum world operate jointly. TIME is
tantamount to the operator of phase conjugation, crucial to holography. Yet, we are no longer
constrained to measurements appearing through Hermitean operators as their eigenvalues: Indeed, M is
non-Hermitean. An important eigenvalue of the logophysical OR operator of the decision process, is the
Golden Mean.
The exchange between the two domains can go in both ways, given that the Klein bottle has no
independent Inside nor Outside, the quantum realm can be incorporated into the classical cognitive
dynamics, while the logical elements can take part in the quantum evolution. Negative probabilities can
be understood too in terms of non-orientability. This connection is what we may venture to be the
support for the Principle of Complementarity in cognitive psychology, the ecological conception of
perception as a system (J J Gibson [300], and to a nonorientable topological monism which we have
elaborated in our works and related to Max Velmans’ Reflexive Monism [301].

Pribram conceived that memory was ‘imprinted’ and processed holographically on the brain
operating as a parallel computer [125], which we suggested operating in terms of Matrix Logic for which
the matricial product is a form of relational connection with several error correcting operations [265].
In holography the brain operates as a phase conjugation logical gate (Mitchell [124]), which points to
TIME for its realization. We have suggested that brain interhemispheric coordination and particularly
visual binocularity operates as such TIME phase conjugacy (Rapoport, [222]). Brain holographics
would operate producing an imaginary image of the quantum emissions, say photons emitted by the
perceived object, which rather than being seen are participants of the process. The brain would use
adaptive resonance of the input signals with the electromagnetic triplet of triplet already discussed, in
its input path to generate the output image representation of the object and further project it as if Outside
where we locate and experience the real object -even in hallucinatory states-, as proposed by Velman’s
Reflexive Monism [323].
As a final comment, the implicit and explicit orders introduced by Bohm are, in principle, incorporated
into this linkage, but making this manifest requires elaboration. Also, the formulation of topological
chemistry as related to cognition through the informational phase is a natural field to be pursued. With
relations to knots as chemical configurations [118] it was examined by Stern [265]
24. On the superposition and interference of as quantum “macroscopic” systems. Penrose &
Hameroff’s theory revisited
Supraduality rather than duality is also the case of the “interference of minds” as superposition of states
elicited in Quantum Cognition, which shows the “quantum-like” nature of the mind, as in decision
processes, conceptualization, perceptual multistability, etc. (Aerts [2], Busemeyer [29], Khrennikov
[100, 101]). Departing with a criticism of the physicalist reductionism for which Penrose & Hameroff
have been mostly disapproved by neuroscientists, Khrennikov modeled the mind as if quantummechanical applying the so called Växjö interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposing a Hilbert space
formalization of the mind in terms of “contextual probabilities”. The Klein Bottle is contextual by
nature. Khrennikov did not consider the neurological aspects in particular the supradual continuous
subthreshold phenomenology of neurons which subtends the action potentials, nor the tubulin analogical
code: The subthreshold phenomenology is indeed proper to quantum topological phases yet as the
physical correlate of Quantum Cognition and the Klein Bottle logophysics of perception and cognition.
That Boolean logic is not the case of the mind states already transpires in the ambiguity and uncertainty
in our daily ponderings. It is the states of superposition which calls our attention, so that besides true
and false states and operators, commutative in Boolean logic, a combination of both is also a mind-state
as already discussed (Conte et.al., [37,38]). This is their take on the non-dual (viz. supradual) logic
quantum-like structure of the mind understood that there is no quantum physical element committed to
the mind but rather the interference and superposition of cognitive states. This runs counter the
allegation that “Quantum behaviors are difficult to reconcile with our observed “classical” world. For
example, we don’t encounter superpositions in our perceived world, as the very act of measurement, or
of conscious observation seems to cause superpositions to reduce to definite states - “collapse of the
wave function.” (Hameroff, p.7, [76]). These comments while appropriate to physical quantum
behaviour in the atomic and particle scale, fails to acknowledge that in the mental world and its
behavioural manifestations, say decision making, superposition, entanglement and disentanglement, or
still gestaltic perception, quantum-like behaviour are the normal rather than unobservable or
unencounterable events. They exist per se as if independent of actual microtubule behaviour though as
claimed by Penrose & Hameroff they can be explained in those terms. In other terms, Penrose and
Hameroff implicitly assume the Cartesian Cut, ab initio. Then naturally, in such a dualistic setting, it is
hard, actually impossible to achieve surmounting the initial dualistic onto-epistemology. For the duallogic logophysics, the mental domain is projected as an object to the presumably physical world of
measurement free of selfreference [230], positivism as its implicit epistemology. According to
McGilchrist this is the signature of the breaking of unity produced by the dominance of the left
hemisphere over the right hemisphere of the brain [312], and very much responsible for the
predicaments of Western culture after Descartes. For the latter see Rapoport [220,222,226,230,236]).

In other words, the 2-value logic is projected to a single value, all things other excluded., as
logician and cybernetist Gotthard Günther claimed to be the inexorable case [302]. Günther criticized
the nature of logic being related to propositional value, and considered it terms of relations displayed
locationally, as appears to be the case of genomes in terms of the Klein Bottle logic [233]. Furthermore,
in our previous discussion of the shape-based topological chemistry, or still in the plethora of physical
phenomena where topological phases are omnipresent, say liquid crystals, acoustics, phonon modes
propagating in lattices, shallow water waves and in scales of experience going down to nanomaterials,
optics, they all manifest a supradual logophysics which is not beyond our pragmatics.
Remarkably, nonorientability and topological anholonomity as well as their bearing in the
topological chemistry paradigm crucial to their unmentioned at all, as it arises in the superposition of
molecular open and closed conformations of proteins, basic to their theory. Penrose & Hameroff do
mention the relevance of π- electron delocalization in aromatics towards the formation of dipoles basic
to ORC OR and further discussed them with regards to both consciousness blocking and enhancement.
As already discussed, Hameroff in his study of computation in microtubules points to the central
important of electron delocalizations at the very basis for hybrid conformations of molecules and the
relevance to consciousness without mentioning their role in topological changes from nonorientability
to orientability and the converse (Hameroff et.al., [74]), and this was carried out to the ORC OR theory
entirely.
Most remarkably, Hameroff considered the 6-layered structure of cortices to suggest the so called
giant pyramidal neurons which constitute layer V as the probable support for consciousness for being
the location apex of the integration of Outside and Inside, the unity of action and perception which for
the visual and somatosensory systems is embodied as a Klein Bottle, the latter as elicited by Werner &
Whitsel [119,281] and proposed by Turvey as a Möbius strip unity [273] somewhat following the
Pragmatist school of the 19th century after William James.
25. The integrated coherence of the brain-mind and the proposal of a non-orientable
architecture associated to its synchronicity
Remarkably, in ORC OR theory, it is claimed that microtubules practice quantum computation in
intervals in which they are isolated from the environment which they alternate with phases of classical
interaction in which coherence is due to synchrony, the 40 Hz oscillation. It is this oscillation which is
identified as providing the integration of the brain-mind, which has been identified as the neuronal
function proper to consciousness (Buszáki [123])
This synchronization has been suggested to be based on an hexagonal lattice of somatosensory
and visual primal cortical areas in which the hypercolumnar structure is unmanifested. In this model
Möbius strip like synaptic patterns support the coherence across the cortex maximising synchronous
oscillation (Wright et.al. [283, 284]). This lattice would arise by selforganisation during embryogenesis
and development of neurons, consistently with the Free Energy Principle (Friston [55],[317]) and
operating as a heterarchy of Markov Blankets -Klein Bottles (Rapoport, [234,236] optimizing adaptive
learning in an analogical transition from vagueness to crispness of percepts. The Möbius strip would
arise as the antenatal organisation of synaptic connection while the receptive field lattice architecture
would be the later post-natal development of learned functional connections overlayed on the antenatal
connection system. The authors suggest that this organisation could be general across the cortex and the
possibility that the underlying principles could extend to the mutual self-organisation of synapses and
interactions between cortical areas. Furthermore, it suggests a modular functional synaptic system,
which, only in some parts of the cortex, and in some species, is manifest as anatomical ordering into
columns. In other words, it would be more basic to the observed periodic pinwheel architecture
supporting topological anholonomy, which would appear only locally across the cortex and for some
species.
26. Further analysis of Penrose & Hameroff ORC OR theory
Upon Penrose & Hameroff presenting their ORC OR theory following the early findings of the Hindu
group they claimed that they provide confirmation of their take that fundamental resonances that arise

in microtubules such as anticipated by them [75,76,192]. This may be the case with regards to the
microtubule dynamics of neurons, but to include this with regards to the theory of “quantum gravity” in
completion of Quantum Mechanics due to the superposition of protein states in microtubules, might
turn to be a step too far, which the authors seem to refrain from stating it explicitly. However, they also
refrain from mentioning the vortical structures and the topological phases revealed by this group in their
investigations of the action potentials arising from the subthreshold cytoskeleton phenomenology. They
chose to posit the appearance of consciousness as arising from the decoherence of the purported
quantum mechanical phenomenology which they refer to massive particles which somehow alter the
coherence of the quantum fluctuations to produce the actual world of experience, consciousness the
mediating agency. For them the collapse of the wave function is an agency-independent physical
phenomenon, thus the “objective reduction” (OR) qualification, which further “provides the bridge
between quantum and classical physics". They depart from extending the Schroedinger equation
modified by random terms associated to quantum fluctuations, which somehow are resolved into
decoherence by the microtubules.
Rather than consciousness producing the collapse of the quantum coherence of the superposition
of protein multiconformations – which they attribute to a misinterpretation of their theory- they chose
to posit the appearance of consciousness as arising from the said collapse. The latter, in their theory, is
an agency independent physical process which produces the world of experience, thus the “objective
reduction” (OR), a materialism of sorts. It is further produced by a superposition of curvaturegravitational fields which each lump is one of the conformations, which we shall discuss below.
As already discussed in the Klein Bottle logophysics topological superposition is the case of
physics, chemistry, cognition, perception, semiosis, etc. Penrose conceives superposition differently. In
his theory the superposition is a spacetime geometry property, entirely unrelated to torsion and
nonorientability, nor the topological phases of the neuron’s cytoskeleton but rather to the curved space
of General Relativity. Hameroff: “…superpositions as tiny separated curvatures in spacetime geometry.
Were such separations to continue… each spacetime curvature would evolve its own universe…”
(p.2,[76]), Penrose deduced that spacetime separations would be unstable, and undergo objective
reductions (OR) independent of a subject and based on the quantum uncertainty principle. In their
theory, OR would stand for an extension of standard quantum mechanics, as the bridge between
quantum- and classical-level physics as a ‘quantum-gravitational’ phenomenon. Whatever this bridge
may originate from, be that environmental decoherence, the participation of an observer through a
measurement of observation of any kind, multibranched universe from which a particular one arises
from a “choice” or any interpretation of how the classical world of one actual alternative may be taken
to arise out of fundamentally quantum-superposed ingredients”. So what “quantum gravity” means for
this theory, is in principle, as recognized by the authors, any theory in which the standard theory, viz.
Schroedinger unitary evolution of quantum states in isolation, is superseded by a theory which considers
the environment interacting with the system as a single system. This has been formalized in several
proposals as the Dynamic Reduction Program or Collapse Theories (Diósi [44], Ghirardi, [62,63] ,
Pearle [186], Percival [188], Hughston [309], Adler and Horwitz [ 310], Rapoport [218] ).
The metric-geometric proposal of ORC OR somewhat neglects the possibility of topological
superposition embodied as nonorientability, and their omnipresent manifestation, say in liquid crystals
pervasive to organisms and the brain itself. which does not presume neither the quantum nor the classical
domains as primal. The Klein Bottle embodies and controls the cycle of transition from coherence to
decoherence and its reconstitution, as a transition from supraduality to duality and the converse.
Furthermore, rather than consciousness producing the OR, Penrose conceives consciousness (“or
an equivalent of it”) as emerging from the OR. The OR process is considered to occur when quantum
superpositions between slightly differing space-times take place, differing from one another by an
integrated space-time measure which compares with the fundamental and extremely tiny Planck (4volume) scale of space-time geometry. Since this is a 4-volume Planck measure, involving both time
and space, we find that the time measure would be particularly tiny when the space-difference measure
is relatively large (as with Schrödinger’s cat)
To this effect Penrose conceived the selfenergy of the superposition acting as a threshold which
upon trespassing it, specific curvature values are selected and the collapse to a single world is
43

eventuated. This threshold would be connected to the gravitational constant, and though smaller than
other constants arising from chemical or other processes, would be of crucial importance for the OR
reduction to proceed, in a time range of 20 orders or magnitude smaller than usual quantum processes.
Neuronal material would be involved in this reduction in order to produce the infinitesimal displacement
and modification of curvature to allow the time threshold to operate in a process in which microtubules
play a crucial role. However, rather than the environment playing a role for the reduction, this would be
spontaneous and operate independently of the environment and in the cases of major masses, still a
quantum entanglement of the environment and the quantum system would operate. Any reduction of
either the environment or the system would be accompanied mutually by the other. This mutuality would
introduce an uncontrollable stochastic element into the result of the reduction. Consequently any nonrandom element (which according to Orch OR is non-computable) which may influence the particular
choice of state produced from the superposition would be completely masked by this randomness.
Further, according to Penrose a quantum-like unit of phenomenal experience, a “quale” occurs,
as a “protoconscious” as a first step for the assessment or constitution of causality. To explain the
reduction which Penrose & Hameroff to be alike a musical morphology of several chords and
instruments -an “orchestra”- proposed that “microtubules inside brain neurons orchestrate quantum
vibrational superpositions through resonance, entanglement and memory, guiding wavefunction
evolution to threshold for “orchestrated OR” (“Orch OR”), events proposed to result in
moments of full, rich conscious experience (more like music than random notes and tones). Sequences
of such moments would give rise to our “stream of consciousness”” (Hameroff, p.3 [76])
Let us analyse the above. In their take consciousness rather than primal is somewhat derivative
and emergent from a spacetime geometry related to the theory of general relativity (GR). Furthermore,
on priming curvature rather than torsion from which in the theory of Cartan connections, i.e. nonnull
torsion, they ignored that the covariant differential of torsion yields the curvature: the so-called Bianchi
identities of the theory of connections, in differential geometry (Cartan [33] , Hehl [83], Sharpe [111],
Sternberg [264] Rapoport and Sternberg [200]). This neglect is quite remarkable since these identities
stand for the constitutive relational aspects of the geometries. Their theory does not consider that
Minkowski or Euclidean space, with their flat null-curvature metric, can be the case with non-null
torsion and still the curvature can be alternatively null or nontrivial, so their curvature is entirely a field
which is derivative of a metric. There are several conceptual issues too. As much as our theoretizations
are linked to the image-schemas we apply and the logic we chose, concepts and their consistence is a
must. Given a metric, say in GR, the geometry is nonrelational -one object distant to the other but no
field proper to the interaction. The metric geometry of GR is nonparticipative, and the principles of
selfreference and hetero-reference- the two core principles of consciousness - are not its basis, torsion
is null and thus nonorientability is not the case. Finally, this notion of spacetime is that of a container,
for physical masses, which is the dual-logophysics purported by Descartes and Newton. But
consciousness which for ORC OR is to emerge from this passive spacetime is not subjected to
CONTAIN, as if a classical though relativistic mass would be the case. Consciousness is not
characterized by containment, as the classical notion of matter is, and at its most basic level is relational
and undissociable from the principles of selfreference and hetero-reference. Since the geometry of GR
is based on metrics, it measures distances, separations between objects, a measure of objectivity which
rules out interpenetration and thus setups a logophysics in which the principle of identity is dominant.
Metamorphosis is outruled as well as setting up for derivatives of this distantiation pragmatics the
hegemony of tertium-non-datur is emplaced: there is not third state but true and false ascriptions. Thus
the mind is deleted. Already at its departure ORC OR vindicates a dual logophysics, AristotelianBoolean logic for its implicit onto-epistemology. Further, the metaphor of music ascribed to the flow of
consciousness begs us to recall that the cognition of music reveals nonorientability (Mazzola [159],
Tymoczko, [274] Shepard [250-253],Risset [237]). The stream of music and that of consciousness are
strongly related [1].
We can state our case invoking the considerations that led to reveal the Klein Bottle as the metaform
of pattern recognition as unappropiate to that effect, using instead the so-called persistent homology
([31,32,127]), which has come to be applied to study neural networks through their topological
invariants. The underlying notion is that data has shape (Carlsson [31,32], Rapoport [232-234], be that

the notion that the fundamental parameter to ponder is the discrete number of firings of a neuron.
Accordingly the choice of the metric geometry in ORC OR appears to be inorganic, an abstraction from
a world of unconnected entities signed by their masses, small for more, and entirely unrelatable, in
principle and in concept, to the process they set themselves to explain, consciousness. With regards to
the spacetime to emerge from the collapse of the quantum states in their theory, shape is not relevant at
all, though it is implicitly the case of the morphology of tubulin in different conformations, particularly
superposition states which they indicate their crucial role to their theory.
Their choice of geometry contravenes the very observation by Hameroff: “Atoms and small
particles appear to exist as quantum superpositions of multiple possibilities, but yet we observe discrete,
definite objects in our perceived “classical” world” ” (p.14 [76]). Notwithstanding this observation in
the “classical” world of forms, metamorphosis mediating, Aristotelian-Boolean logic is already
superseded by supraduality. This is so particularly when instead of focusing in material structures
considered synchronically we do so in considering processes, diachronically, processually, particularly
those that arise in perception and cognition, say of the Necker cube, or Gestalt figures. Still to mention,
also upon considering the mind, certainly is no object but for itself and for others exercising their theory
of the mind making.
To explain the biophysics on which ORC is established and the relations with anaesthesia these
authors considered for the main characteristics of the molecules, mainly liquid crystals and in particular
water, their polarity and non-polarity properties. However, the nonorientable topologies of liquid
crystals and water are entirely disconsidered, despite being crucial to cell physiology, namely to
establish its overall coherence. The topological chemistry paradigm and in particular the two-version
topology (Huckel and Huckel-Möbius) due to π- -electrons delocalization in aromatics is explicited by
their theory, though no reference to topology but for tagging. After all the binding of molecules which
is crucial to their model as the anaesthetic binds to tubulin is all about shaping accommodations, a
topological issue. As early discussed by Sokolov they can be represented as modifications of the
molecules electron distribution and the associated shape modifications and of topology. As Mezey puts
it, the electron charge distribution of molecules is “fuzzy” ([118]). The three-dimensional shape of the
molecule begs for topology, rather than valence skeleton representations: “molecules are not
geometrical but topological objects” (p.8) and molecular shape is dynamical. The shape of a molecule
is the molecule’s electron distribution shape.
To put in terms of Hameroff & Penrose: “Non-polar anaesthetic binding sites in tubulin (and other
proteins) are comprised largely of π- electron resonance clouds of benzene-like organic rings in
aromatic amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. The basis for organic chemistry, πelectron resonance clouds are delocalized quantum objects, non-polar, but polarizable, and can induce
and couple quantum dipoles, participate in quantum optical effects, and oscillate coherently in terahertz
frequency ranges” [75]. This is it, in essence and concept. However, upon presenting the main argument
for superposition in microtubules they do so in presenting the multiconformations of tubulin as shapes
which are conceived either as unsuperposed or superposed interpreted as qubits. This is the basis for
their “topological quantum computing” without ever mentioning the Hadamard-Klein Bottle
information phase which is central to Quantum Information theory and supports transcending from
classical to quantum computations, as already discussed.
These terahertz range frequencies are crucial to the whole range of oscillations of the cytoskeleton
as a hierarchical triplet of triplets architecture which resonate in a range from hertz to terahertz eliciting
topological phases (Bandyopadhyay [14], Gosh et.al. [64], Singh et.al. [134,254-256], Saxena et.al.
[246]), and which make of the cytoskeleton a time-crystal. However, the topological anholonomities are
still wanting for consideration to the genesis of spacetime consciousness. They claim a “quantum
gravity” which would resolve the superposed states each producing a spacetime curvature into a single
state, that of the manifest reality, a resolution which -they pledge- is tantamount to the emergence of
conscious agency, through the so-called collapse of the wave function. Again, the left hemisphere dual
over-rule is rather absolute, as McGilchrist puts it.

27 . Objective reductions and the dynamical reduction program
Basil Hiley showed that the quantum behaviour of particles can be described solely by using a hierarchy
of Clifford algebras without recourse of wave functions nor Hilbert space. The essential aspect is the
non-commutativity of Clifford algebras and the existence of idempotent elements which substitute the
projectors of the standard theory [28]. We have just shown that in Matrix Logic the torsion produced by
the commutator of FALSE and TRUE which are not dual in distinction with scalar Boolean logic, is
nilpotent due to their status as projectors/idempotents. In the Klein Bottle logophysics noncommutativity is found in the chirality of taking the path around the singularity as in fig 3, either
clockwise or anticlockwise produces a change of sign in the torsion closure. Covariantly represented in
𝑎

differential geometry terms, the torsion as a (2,1)-tensor 𝑇𝑏𝑎𝑐 is anticommutative : 𝑇𝑏𝑐
we change the order of the covariant indices, a change of sign is introduced [33,81-84,264,276].
Elio Conte upon noticing that the fundamental novelty of Quantum Mechanics is the noncommutatitivity of the product of operators of which Quantum Cognition sets to represent the decision
process in terms of projectors in Hibert space, proposed instead a formulation using Clifford algebras,
just alike Hiley (see Conte [37,38]). In this setting the 𝑒3 idempotent, which he identified as the core
element of the formalism, operates precisely as the previous decoherence. This topological decoherence
contrasts not only with the quantum to classical physics transitions, but fundamentally with the
resolution of quantum superpositions in Hameroff & Penrose ORC OR, where multiple states are
reduced to one single state.
As we stated already a geometry with null torsion is such that selfreference and hetero-reference
do not operate to its constitution if not banally, by their erasure. The issue is that there is no
consciousness, whatever its mode, which is not supported by these two principles. For proof, the mirrorneuron phenomenology introduced by Rizzolatti et.al.. [238,50]. In particular we note that in the mind’s
resolution of superposition, as shown by Quantum Cognition, the mind entertains to consideration the
different possible alternatives, consciously we can say at least of some of the possibilities and
unconsciously too. It is the process of topological decoherence which produces the single unsuperposed
classical state by action of the Hadamerd-Klein-Bottle-gate, and this appears to operate as if
unconsciously. So consciousness appears to be primal rather than appearing as the process of singling
out one mind-state alone from a superposition or multiple possible states.
The geometry of quantum states whose state vectors arise from the wave-like, quantum-level
objects which evolve deterministically by the Schrodinger equation on state-space, also known as
Quantum Geometry, is a projective Hilbert space [20] . Indeed a phase is a component in Quantum
Mechanics which cannot be disconsidered, and very much so in logic with imaginary states too
(Kauffman [112]). It is precisely this space on which Berry discovered the topological phase. A
trajectory of a state-vector under the natural antipodal state-vectors identification produces a Möbius
strip.
We already mentioned the Dynamical Reduction Program (DRP) or wave collapse theories as an
attempt to complete Quantum Mechanics by accounting for the measuring or observing subject. On the
one hand what we observe is discrete though seemingly continuous, while the cognitive process is
analogical, continuous though framed in finite intervals, and mostly so when we are in a state of
unconsciousness. We already discussed that despite the uncertainty whether perception is ultimately
discrete or continuous, the latter can optimally be reconstituted from a discrete signal by sampling as if
on a Möbius surface or a Klein Bottle. However, this reconstitution is always under noise, which is
conceived as random. We also discussed that both the visual and somatosensory Klein Bottle maps
embody these reconstitution under uncertainty.
The DRP approach consists in accepting that the dynamical equation of the standard theory should
be modified by the addition of stochastic and nonlinear terms. After all, both the system, the observer
and the instruments being applied to elicit the interrelations are all subjected to quantum fluctuations
arising from the vacuum. The remarkable fact is that the resulting theory is capable, on the basis of a
single dynamics which is assumed to govern all natural processes, to account at the same time for all
well-established facts about microscopic systems as described by the standard theory, as well as for the

so-called postulate of wave packet reduction (WPR), which accompanies the interaction of a
microscopic system with a measuring device.
Given a Hilbert space of dimension n+1 , since the quantum state vectors are defined up to a phase,
this leads to CP(n), the n-dimensional complex projective space of “rays” of quantum vector states
whose evolution is deterministic as characterized by the Schroedinger equation for quantum state
vectors. Upon measurement a state-vector reduction to a particular eigenstate is eventuated, the so called
collapse of the wave function. This process can be described in “objective” agent-free mode by a
nonlinear Schroedinger equation on CP(n) which assumes a non-isolation of the system vis-à-vis the
environment.
This requires Stochastic Differential Geometry, yet not in configuration space or spacetime [180]
but on CP(n) (see Hughston [309], Rapoport [218]). Remarkably, the Schroedinger equation on
configuration space or spacetime manifold can be derived from Brownian motion with the drift
vectorfield given by the logarithmic gradient of the logarithm of the wavefunction (Rapoport, [201206,208,210-219,226,227]. They are crucial to Nelson’s derivation of the Schroedinger equation in
Stochastic Mechanics [172]) in terms of Brownian motions arising from quantum vacuum fluctuations
and diffusion processes [174]). The logarithmic singularities of the eikonal- propagating torsion field
may undergo quantum jumps [220,221], a primal distinction to the creation of visual experience
[220,221,226].These Brownian motions are produced by dynamical geometries with torsion vectorfields
or differential form 1-forms, Riemann-Cartan-Weyl connections: they are the basis for Stochastic
Differential Geometry [201-204,2010]). The Laplacian operator has an additional to the metric
Laplacian a first-order term given by the trace-torsion, the drift of the Brownian motions, so it fits
exactly to the Fokker-Planck diffusion operator, or still, the differential generator of the generalized
Brownian motion ([200-221,226]).Both the Fokker-Planck operator and the stochastic differential
equation which extends the Schroedinger equation to the open case are intrinsic, they do not depend on
any coordinate system ([218]). In the latter geometric formulation there is no separation of the quantum
system and the apparatus/observer.
This extends to Brownian motion on CP(n) as a stochastic differential equation whose stochastic
solution is a diffeomorphism of state-space, while the closed system case evolution produces a
diffeomorphism of configuration space. With regards to the metric in the Quantum Geometry it is the
Fubini-Study metric, while in configuration space metrics can be either positive-definite for the nonrelativistic case or degenerate in the relativistic case (Oron and Hurwitz [180] , respectively (In the
case of the Navier-Stokes of fluid-dynamics where the drift-torsion field is the velocity of the fluid,
these diffeomorphisms stand for the solution flow of the Navier-Stokes equation [211-217;89] ) .
In short, the standard Schroedinger flow on CP(n) is generalized to a random flow which has an
additional term, a drift-torsion vector field, given by the gradient of the expectation value of the quantum
Hamiltonian and the gradient of the variance of the Hamiltonian, the squared energy quantum
uncertainty (Rapoport [218]). It is this torsion-drift term which drives the system to a fixed eigenstate.
The noise term of this random flow also proportional to the gradient of the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the Planck’s constant, the gravitational constant and the velocity
of light c, in a form that for the superposition of macroscopic systems which differ in little as a proton
mass, the collapse to a single eigenstate is almost immediate (Hughston [309], Adler and Horwitz [310])
In this Stochastic Differential Geometry setting, the reduction of the quantum state to a single eigenstate
does not require an observer for the system to collapse, so hardly we can attribute this as associated to
an emerging consciousness, or a consciousness at all if not that probabilities and their expected values
are involved. But then probabilities have a subjective-objective nature, rather than builtin into the
quantum system. They have an epistemic function, a mode of knowledge through description, yet
supported by a supradual ontology based on the principle of selfreference and hetero-reference.
28. Conclusions
We have presented a geometrical-topological theory which surmounts the paradigmatic divisions
produced by the Cartesian Cut, and applied it to the study of consciousness, proposing a novel paradigm.
Upon unfolding the presentation, it has been shown that the diverse manifestations of the physical -in

the broad sense- and mental domains are derivatives of the supradual logophysics which is based on the
principles of selfreference and hetero-reference, which operates even when an agent is absent. Having
said and done, briefness is compelling, a long monograph forthcoming. It has transpired that the
transdisciplinarian approach which the supradual logophysics supports, transcending the dual logic
hegemonic in science and philosophy, also transcends the somewhat piecemeal knowledge that dualism
can afford and manage through the recourse to interdisciplinarity, notwithstanding the courage,
competence and brilliance that may be exercised in doing the job. The issue is that a choice of what
logic is, means and does, is tantamount to the choice of an ontology fused with an epistemology: This
is already the case of dual Aristotelian -Boolean logic which by default, and transparently so, produces
fractures which cannot be salvaged if not transcending it, ab initio (Günther, [302], Rapoport [230]).
Methodology ultimately is the choice of the logic, in the first place, rather than a decantation of what is
left implicit. The usual consideration is that it comes without commitments: if so why the effects of
dualism show so much on the contrary and we can still claim blindness?
Rather than a putative theory of quantum gravity for explaining the purported physical source for
consciousness or a no less definable panpsychism that can profess little more than its argumentation, an
omnipresent supradual logophysics which supports a world of signs and meaning as unseparable of the
material-energetic-information domain, offers its cornucopia cum integral meaning (Rapoport,2022).
Acknowledgements My deep appreciation to Prof. Martin Land and Prof. Larry Horwitz for their kind
invitation to present a correspondent contribution for the Proceedings of IARD 2022.Our gratitude as
well to Prof. Lou Kauffman and Prof. Stein Johansen for their interest in my work.I dedicate this work
to two persons. Firstly, my wife Sonia; without her support this would have ever been. This work was
somewhat initiated in México, where I arrived in December 1985 to leave early 1987 following the
earthquake and unfortunately, loss contact with ever after. Fortune and destiny, I soon met scientistthinker Dr. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum (México City, 1946-?,?), and started to participate together
with my wife in the seminar on consciousness, at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, where
Jacobo had his neuropsychology laboratory at the Psychology Faculty. The experience I had developed
prior to my arrival in México, torsion geometry and supraduality in mathematical physics became a
central topic of discussion and related to Jacobo’s own work, particularly his syntergics. From these
meetings we came to conceive the brain-mind as a torsion dislocated lattice extending beyond the body,
and most fundamentally operating selfreferentially and hetero-referentially. At that time, the Klein
Bottle was not considered at all. In parting away, Jacobo insisted that I should start putting into writing
our understandings and enquiries, an invitation which I had repeatedly declined to do so. I took thirty
years to start putting it into practice. This work is an homage to Jacobo, a man of integrity, extremely
gifted, moved by an extraordinary curiosity, enthusiasm, and the will to service humankind. Wish he
would have been here.
