Sleep plays a role in the consolidation of declarative memories. Although this influence has attracted
much attention at the level of behavioural performance, few reports have searched for neural correlates. Here, we studied the impact of sleep upon memory for the context in which stimuli were learned
at both behavioural and neural levels. Participants retrieved the association between a presented foreground object and its encoding context following a 12-h retention interval including either wake only or
wake plus a night of sleep. Since sleep has been shown to selectively enhance some forms of emotional
memory, we examined both neutral and emotionally valenced contexts. Behaviourally, less forgetting
was observed across retention intervals containing sleep than retention intervals containing only wakefulness, and this benefit was accompanied by stronger responses in hippocampus and superior parietal
cortex. This sleep-related reduction in forgetting did not differ between neutral and negative contexts, but
there was a clear interaction between sleep and context valence at the functional level, with left amygdala, right parahippocampus, and other components of the episodic memory system all responding more
strongly during correct memory for emotional contexts post-sleep. Connectivity between right parahippocampus and bilateral amygdala/periamygdala was also enhanced during correct post-sleep attribution
of emotional contexts. Because there was no interaction between sleep and valence in terms of context
memory performance these functional results may be associated with memory for details about the emotional encoding context rather than for the link between that context and the foreground object. Overall,
our data show that while context memory decays less across sleep than across an equivalent period of
wake, the sleep-related protection of such associations is not influenced by context emotionality in the
same way as direct recollection of emotional information.

1. Introduction
Consolidation is the gradual reorganisation and stabilisation
of labile, newly encoded memories (McGaugh, 2000). Both lesion
work and neuroimaging suggest that consolidation involves alterations in the way memories are represented in the brain such that
they cease to depend upon the hippocampus and become increasingly integrated with existing neocortical traces (Eichenbaum,
2000; Frankland & Bontempi, 2005).

A growing literature supports a role for sleep, particularly slow
wave sleep (SWS), in declarative memory consolidation (Benedict,
Scheller, Rose-John, Born, & Marshall, 2009; Gais & Born, 2004; Lau,
Tucker, & Fishbein, 2010; Plihal and Born, 1997; Rasch, Buchel, Gais,
& Born, 2007; Takashima et al., 2006), see (Born, 2010; Diekelmann
& Born, 2010; Walker, 2009) for reviews, but see also (Vertes,
2004). This includes work showing reduced episodic memory decay
across sleep as compared to wakefulness (Takashima et al., 2006),
enhanced episodic memory after sleep (Plihal & Born, 1997), and
enhanced episodic memory after artificial stimulation of slowwaves (Marshall, Helgadottir, Molle, & Born, 2006). Additionally,
work in both rats (Hoffman & McNaughton, 2002; Nadasdy, Hirase,
Czurko, Csicsvari, & Buzsaki, 1999; Wilson & McNaughton, 1994)
and humans (Maquet et al., 2000; Peigneux et al., 2004; Rasch et al.,
2007) shows that the neural ensembles associated with learning
reactivate spontaneously during sleep, and that such reactiva-

tion can predict subsequent performance improvements (Peigneux
et al., 2004). Few studies have extended these observations to
examine the brain correlates through which overnight sleep influences the consolidation of declarative memories in humans, but see
(Takashima et al., 2006) for work on daytime napping, and (Gais
et al., 2007) for a study using sleep deprivation.
A number of reports (Hu, Stylos-Allan, & Walker, 2006; Nishida,
Pearsall, Buckner, & Walker, 2009; Payne, Stickgold, Swanberg, &
Kensinger, 2008; Payne & Kensinger, 2011; Sterpenich et al., 2007,
2009; Wagner, Degirmenci, Drosopoulos, Perras, & Born, 2005;
Wagner, Hallschmid, Rasch, & Born, 2006) suggest that sleep plays
a selective role in the consolidation of emotional memories. While
neutral memories are gradually forgotten over time (Frankland &
Bontempi, 2005; McGaugh, 2000) such decay is less apparent in
emotional memories (LaBar & Cabeza, 2006) for a review. Retention of emotional memories across sleep has been associated both
with reduced decay (Wagner et al., 2005, 2006) and with facilitated enhancement (Hu et al., 2006; Nishida et al., 2009; Payne &
Kensinger, 2011; Payne et al., 2008) compared to neutral memories
or retention across equivalent periods of wake. To date, this work
is largely behavioural, but there is increasing interest in the effects
of sleep and sleep deprivation on the neural correlates of memory
for emotional material (Payne & Kensinger, 2011; Sterpenich et al.,
2007, 2009).
In the current report, we set out to extend this literature
by examining the impact of sleep upon memory for the context in which presented images were first encountered. We
studied both neutral and negative contexts, and used functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the impact of retention across a 12-h period containing either wakefulness alone
or wakefulness plus a night of sleep. Because retrieval-related
responses in the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as connectivity between these, are modulated by instructions at test, we
used a paradigm which elegantly manipulates this factor (Smith,
Henson, Rugg, & Dolan, 2005; Smith, Stephan, Rugg, & Dolan,
2006). Thus, contextual stimuli were presented only at encoding, where they were paired with neutral objects that were later
presented as retrieval cues. Participants indicated whether these
cues were originally paired with an emotional or neutral image
(explicit emotional memory task) or an image containing people
or no people (implicit emotional memory task). This paradigm
provides two important advantages in the study of emotional
memory. First, because only neutral information is presented at
test, retrieval-related responses in the emotional memory system cannot be due to the mere processing of externally presented
emotional stimuli, and are more likely associated with emotional
memory. Second, unlike more traditional recollection or recall
paradigms in which superior memory for emotional items may
be due to the greater semantic interrelatedness of these stimuli (Talmi & Moscovitch, 2004; Talmi, Schimmack, Paterson, &
Moscovitch, 2007), the context memory paradigm is not susceptible to the confounding influences of relatedness among
contexts. Using the context memory paradigm, we explored effects
of brain state (sleep/wakefulness) during retention, emotionality of encoding contexts (negative/neutral), and retrieval task
(emotion-relevant/emotion-irrelevant) on context memory and its
neural correlates. We predicted superior memory performance and
stronger neural responses in regions of known importance for contextual memory such as the hippocampus and parahippocampus
(Bar, Aminoff, & Schacter, 2008) at retrieval after sleep. We further predicted that all such effects would be amplified for valenced
information, and more apparent in the explicitly emotion-relevant
retrieval task. Because sleep and wake groups were tested at different times of the diurnal cycle, we also performed a daytime
napping study to control for any impact of circadian variations upon
performance.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experiment 1—overnight consolidation
2.1.1. Participants
Twenty-two (12 female) healthy right-handed volunteers aged 19–32 years
(mean = 24.5 years ± 3.3 SD) and free from any history of sleep pathologies, memory difficulties, or other neurological disorders, were recruited. All participants gave
written informed consent and abstained from alcohol and caffeine for 24 h preceding and throughout the study period. The study was approved by the Ethical Review
Board at the University of Liverpool.
2.1.2. Task
We used an established contextual memory paradigm (Smith, Dolan, & Rugg,
2004; Smith, Henson, Dolan, & Rugg, 2004; Smith et al., 2005, 2006) in which neutral
images of objects (foreground objects) were superimposed upon either negative or
neutral background images (encoding contexts) at encoding (see Fig. 1C and below
for detail). At test, foreground objects were displayed as cues and participants were
asked to retrieve information about the encoding contexts with which these had
been initially paired. The test phase consisted of two different task conditions: an
emotion-relevant condition (Emotion) and an emotion-irrelevant condition (People). In Emotion, participants indicated whether the encoding context associated
with each presented foreground object were emotional or neutral. In People they
indicated whether or not the encoding context contained people.
To examine the influence of sleep upon consolidation, a 12-h retention interval
was introduced between encoding and the final test session (Fig. 1A). Participants
were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: ‘Wake’ and ‘Sleep’ with 6
females and 5 males in each group. In the Wake group, Encoding occurred in the
morning (9 AM ± 1 h) and Test occurred in the evening (9 PM ± 1 h) such that the
retention interval included a normal day during which participants did not sleep. In
the Sleep group, however, Encoding occurred in the evening (9 PM ± 1 h) and Test
occurred in the morning (9 AM ± 1 h). For this group, the retention interval included
a night of sleep (Fig. 1A).
The combination of the two retrieval tasks, the two retention groups, and the two
encoding context valences produced a 2 × 2 × 2 design with the factors: task (Emotion/People), group (Sleep/Wake), and encoding context valence (negative/neutral).
This allowed comparison of responses associated with the retrieval of negative and
neutral memories as a function of both task and retention interval type.
Encoding procedure: Following the method of Smith et al. (2006), each encoding
context was shown for 3 s (Fig. 1C) during encoding outside the fMRI scanner. The
foreground object was then superimposed on it for five further seconds before both
images were replaced with a fixation cross for a further second (Fig. 1C). Participants
were asked to form an association between the foreground object and the encoding
context, and then press a button. To facilitate learning, the 160 image pairs were
separated into two lists of 80, 40 for use in Emotion and 40 for use in People. Importantly, these lists were counterbalanced to contain equal proportions of negative/no
people, negative/people, neutral/no people and neutral/people images.
Immediate tests: Immediately after encoding, in order to strengthen memory
representations, participants were tested twice with feedback. Here, the learned
foreground objects were presented for 2.5 s, followed by a 0.8-s inter-stimulusinterval (ISI). The order of presentation was pseudorandom, and stimuli were
equally divided between the two retrieval tasks. In Emotion, there were 3 possible
responses: ‘old originally paired with a negative encoding context’, ‘old originally
paired with a neutral encoding context’, and ‘old but I can’t remember the encoding
context’. In People, the response options were equivalent but indicated whether the
encoding context contained people or not rather than whether it was negative or
neutral. The two tasks were interleaved in 20 alternating blocks of 10 trials each.
A screen stating Emotion or People respectively proceeded each block for 2 s and
reminded participants of the task and the three possible responses by listing them
in terms of finger position. To strengthen memory of the pairing between foreground
objects and encoding contexts, participants were shown the correct encoding context for each object after every response in the immediate test. In order to ensure
good performance in the subsequent delayed test in the MRI scanner, participants
undertook this immediate test twice with feedback directly after encoding. They
took a brief break after completing the second immediate test for the first encoding
list, then commenced the same procedure of encoding followed by two immediate
tests of the second list. Data from the second immediate test was taken as a measure
of pre-consolidation performance.
Testing procedure: Following the 12-h retention interval, participants performed
a Test session in the MRI scanner. This was similar to the immediate tests described
in the Encoding section above, except that no feedback was given. Additionally the
learned foreground objects were randomly intermixed with 40 new foreground
objects and 80 ‘null’ events in which the crosshair simply stayed on the screen
for the 3-s inter trial interval. This created a stochastic distribution of stimulus
onset asynchronies, allowing more accurate estimation of responses to stimuli vs.
interstimulus baseline (Friston, Zarahn, Josephs, Henson, & Dale, 1999). Finally, in
addition to the three response options used during immediate tests (see above), participants could also respond ‘new’ to indicate that they had not seen a foreground
object before. It is noteworthy that this testing procedure, along with the timing
of stimulus presentation, was identical to that used by Smith et al. (2006). As with

Fig. 1. Experimental paradigm and context memory task. (A) The design of Experiment 1, which used an overnight consolidation delay. Participants were divided into a
Wake group trained in the morning and a Sleep group trained in the evening. Each group was tested in the MRI scanner 12 ± 1 h after encoding. The Sleep group therefore
consolidated across a night of sleep, while the Wake group consolidated across a day of wakefulness. (B) The design of Experiment 2, which used a daytime napping paradigm.
Participants were divided into Nap and Wake groups, these groups were trained and identical times in the day, with the Nap group consolidating across a 90-min nap while
the Wake group remained awake. (C) The context memory task (Smith et al., 2006) during Encoding participants viewed a context picture for 3 s before a foreground object
was superimposed on it for a further 5 s. Participants formed an association between the encoding context and the foreground object, then responded with a button press. At
Test (D) foreground objects were shown for 2.5 s, followed by a crosshair for 0.8 s. Testing was divided into two tasks: Emotion and People. In Emotion, there were 3 possible
responses: old originally paired with a negative encoding context, old originally paired with a neutral encoding context, and old but I cannot remember the encoding context.
In People the response options were equivalent but participants indicated whether the encoding context contained people or not rather than whether it was negative or
neutral. Training included two tests with feedback in which the encoding context was displayed after the subject had responded. Delayed testing (after the retention period)
was carried out in the MRI scanner and did not include feedback. In Delayed testing, learned foreground objects were intermixed with novel (unlearned) foreground objects,
and participants had an additional response option ‘new’ in both tasks.

Encoding, the Test session was split into equal halves. Data were collected in two
separate fMRI runs, with a brief resting break in between (participants remained in
the scanner).
2.1.3. Analysis of behavioural data
Behavioural performance was assessed using correctly attributed encoding
contexts (context memory) and correctly recognised foreground objects (object
recognition). Object recognition was quantified by combining context memory
with items in which the foreground object was correctly remembered but the
encoding context was wrong and items in which the foreground object was
remembered but encoding context was unknown. Forgetting was measured as
the performance change between immediate and delayed memory tests (forgetting = immediate − delayed) in terms of both context memory (context forgetting)
and object recognition (object forgetting). Our analysis used a combination of
ANOVAs and t-tests, with a two-tailed p < 0.05 considered as significant.
During analysis, objects from both People and Emotion tasks were divided, on
the basis of whether or not the encoding context with which they were associated
was negative. The Emotion task measured the impact of an emotional encoding
context upon subsequent memory of explicitly emotional information about this

context, while the People task measured the impact of an emotional encoding
context upon subsequent memory for neutral information about this context (the
presence/absence of people). The People task can therefore be thought of as a measure of implicitly emotional memory.
2.1.4. Stimuli
Encoding contexts were photographs taken from the IAPS battery (Lang,
Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005) (negative items were among the most strongly
valenced images in the battery) and supplemented with images from the internet. Pictures ranged from everyday scenes, to images of injury, violence, decay
and contaminated foods. 160 photographs were used as encoding contexts
and were composed from four equal categories: neutral with people, neutral without people, negative with people, and negative without people. The
320 neutral foreground objects were taken from the Hemera objects collection, http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/stockphotovendors/gr/photoobjects1-2.htm,
and appeared on a square yellow background. Eight unique sets of pairings between
foreground objects and encoding context photographs were created pseudorandomly, avoiding pairings where a semantic relationship could easily be produced
between the foreground object and encoding context. The eight encoding lists were

2622

presented in a random order, counterbalanced across participants (Smith et al.,
2006).
2.1.5. MRI scanning
Scanning was performed using a 3-T Trio MRI scanner (Siemens Vision, Erlangen,
Germany) with an 8 channel head coil. Stimuli were back-projected onto a screen at
the rear of the magnet bore and viewed via an angled mirror attached to the headcoil. Responses were made using a custom-built button box which recorded these
with accuracy of ∼1 ms.
2.1.6. Imaging parameters
T2-weighted echo planar images (EPI) with BOLD (blood-oxygen-leveldependent) contrast were acquired using a specialized sequence which minimized
signal dropout in the medial temporal lobe (Deichmann, Gottfried, Hutton, & Turner,
2003). We used the following scanning parameters to achieve whole brain coverage: 33 oblique axial slices at a 20◦ tilt in the anterior–posterior axis, TR of 2 s, slice
thickness of 2 mm (80% gap), TE of 30 ms, in plane resolution was 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm.
Data were collected in two separate sessions (runs). Each session lasted 9 min, giving
270 volumes. High resolution anatomical whole brain images were obtained using a
T1 weighted 3D-gradient-echo pulse sequence, with the following parameters: (T1
190, TR 7.92, TE 2.48, FOV 224 × 256, matrix 256 × 256 × 256 pixels, flip angle 16)
acquired in sagittal plane.
2.1.7. fMRI processing
Functional MRI images were analysed using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) software package (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging London,
UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). After the first three volumes of each session
were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects, images were corrected for head
motion by realigning with the first image of the first session and spatially normalised
to an EPI template corresponding to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain.
Normalised images were smoothed using a Gaussian Kernel size with a full width
at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm.
fMRI analysis: To characterise functional responses, data were examined using a
two-level random effects analysis. At the first level, the event-related design matrix
contained regressors for: context memory, items in which the participant correctly
recognized an old foreground object but attributed the encoding context incorrectly, items in which the participant correctly recognized an old foreground object
but indicated that they did not remember the encoding context, and misses. These
regressors were included separately for each valence (neutral and negative encoding contexts) and for each task (Emotion and People). Correct rejections were also
modelled separately for each task. To control for motion artefacts, six rigid body
movement parameters were included as regressors of no interest. Parameter estimates reflecting the height of the hemodynamic response function for each regressor
were calculated at each voxel. Contrast images relating to specific combinations of
correctly classified items were calculated. These included (a) negative context memory, (b) neutral context memory, (c) correct rejections, and (d) direct comparison of
context memory across valences (negative context memory > neutral context memory). These four contrasts were computed separately for data from Emotion, data
from People, and for data pooled across both tasks.
The resulting contrast images were entered into two second-level random effects ANOVA analyses. The first such analysis (contrast 1) examined the
main impact of retention type (sleep vs. wake) upon context retrieval. Context
retrieval included both neutral and negative items and was calculated as context retrieval = [all context memory > all correct rejections]. In calculating context
retrieval, the subtraction of correct rejections provided two functions. First, it controlled for circadian factors by removing activities associated with retrieval at a
specific time of day following the method of (Walker, Stickgold, Alsop, Gaab, &
Schlaug, 2005). Second, it allowed separation of context retrieval responses from
those indexing stimulus processing. To determine the impact of retention type upon
these responses context retrieval was compared across Sleep and Wake groups.
Specifically, contrast 1 = [Sleep (context retrieval) < > Wake (context retrieval)]. To
constrain sleep-related findings to the episodic memory system, the results of this
contrast were inclusively masked by the main effect of context retrieval (all context
memory > all correct rejections) in both Sleep and Wake groups at p = 0.05 uncorrected, see Fig. S1 and Table S1A of the supplementary material. The second contrast
(contrast 2) isolated brain responses specifically associated with overnight changes
in processing negative emotional memories. This was achieved by calculating the
interaction: [Sleep (negative context memory > neutral context memory) < > Wake
(negative context memory > neutral context memory)] (contrast 2). Here, the subtraction of neutral context memory from negative context memory controlled for
circadian factors by removing activities associated with retrieval at a specific time
of day and isolated effects associated with retrieval of negative emotional items
rather than with retrieval in general. To constrain findings to areas associated with
emotional processing, the results of this contrast were inclusively masked by the
main effect of valence on context memory (negative context memory > neutral context memory), see Fig. S2 and Table S1B of the supplementary material) at p = 0.05
uncorrected. To examine the influence of retrieval task, both contrasts were calculated first using data pooled across both tasks, next using data from Emotion, and
third using data from People. Finally, task-specific effects were tested by comparing contrasts across tasks, e.g. using Emotion (contrast 1 or 2) < > People (contrast 1

or 2). We followed a well established approach in which clusters of K = 10 or more
voxels at p < 0.001 were considered significant.
Connectivity analysis: Functional connectivity was assessed using the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to evaluate how activity between brain
regions covaries in relation to task demands (Friston et al., 1997; Gitelman, Penny,
Ashburner, & Friston, 2003). We used the PPI to determine whether functional
connectivity between our seed region and other brain areas was more strongly modulated by emotion in participants who slept during the retention interval than in
participants who remained awake. SPM2 was used to extract the effects of interest
time series for our seed region, which fell in the peak voxel the right parahippocampus (4 mm radius sphere centred on x,y,z; 24, −16, −20, identified in contrast 2,
Fig. 4C), this was the physiological effect. Next, the product of this time course
and the contrast (negative context memory > neutral context memory), our psychological factor, was calculated, to create the psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
term. A first level design matrix was then constructed for each participant using
three regressors: (i) the physiological factor, (ii) the psychological factor, and (iii)
the interaction between the first and the second regressors (PPI). To control for
motion artefacts, six rigid body movement parameters were included as regressors
of no interest. Contrasts for the interaction term (PPI) revealed brain regions considered to covary with the parahippocampal seed region. These connectivity contrasts
were then taken through to a second-level, random-effects analysis where we tested
for differences between Sleep and Wake groups. As previously, data were thresholded at p = 0.001 uncorrected and clusters of 10 or more contiguous voxels (K = 10)
are reported (see Table 2). The PPI analysis was performed three times: using data
pooled across tasks, using Emotion task data, and using People task data.
2.2. Experiment 2—daytime napping
Because the Sleep and Wake groups in Experiment 1 were trained and tested at
different times of day (see Fig. 1A), between group performance differences could
potentially have resulted from circadian factors rather than differential consolidation across wake and sleep. To control for this possibility, we performed a second
experiment in which participants from Nap and Wake groups were trained and
tested at equivalent times of day (11 AM and 4 PM), with the Nap group obtaining a
daytime nap between training and testing, while the Wake group remained awake
throughout this interval (see Fig. 1B). Further details of the experiment are given
below.
2.2.1. Participants
Thirty-eight (28 female) healthy volunteers aged 18–34 years
(mean = 20.9 years ± 3.7 SEM) and free from any history of sleep pathologies,
memory difficulties, or other neurological disorders, were recruited for this experiment. Psychology undergraduates took part in exchange for course credit, whereas
other participants were paid £15. All participants gave written informed consent
in line with the School of Psychological Sciences Research Ethics Committee at
the University of Manchester. All participants were free of any history of sleep
pathologies, memory difficulties, or other neurological disorders. Furthermore,
participants abstained from alcohol and caffeine for 24 h preceding and throughout
the study period.
2.2.2. Paradigm
Participants were randomly assigned to Wake and Nap groups. Each group contained 19 participants comprising 14 females and 5 males. For both groups, encoding
began at 11 AM and the delayed test at 4 PM (Fig. 1B). After the immediate test, participants in the Wake group were free to go about their usual daytime activities until
they returned at 4 PM. Participants in the Nap group remained in the Manchester
Sleep Laboratory, where they were wired up for polysomnography (approximately
1 h), then given an opportunity to nap comfortably from 1 PM to 3 PM. After awakening, they were allowed time to remove the electrodes and recover from sleep
inertia before the delayed test commenced at 4 PM. Together, the two retention
groups and two encoding context valences produced a 2 × 2 mixed design with the
between subject factor participant group (Wake/Nap) and the within subjects factor
encoding context valence (negative/neutral).
2.2.3. Task
Experiment 2 used the same context memory paradigm as Experiment 1 (Smith,
Dolan, et al., 2004; Smith, Henson, et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005, 2006) but with
several minor alterations. To facilitate deep encoding of emotional contexts, participants rated each encoding context on a scale of 1 (highly negative) through
9 (highly positive) before forming an association between foreground object and
encoding context. Because both Emotion and People tasks showed the same pattern
of behavioural results in Experiment 1, only the Emotion task was used at test in
Experiment 2. In this task, participants indicated whether or not each presented
foreground object had been paired with an emotional encoding context.
Because we did not perform fMRI in Experiment 2, there was no need to ensure
the high level of response accuracy which was required in Experiment 1. The immediate test was therefore performed only once and did not include feedback. Instead, it
followed the same procedure as the delayed test in Experiment 1, with 20% new foreground objects pseudorandomly intermixed with the learned foreground objects
(different ‘new’ foreground objects were used for immediate and delayed tests).

This inclusion of new items in the immediate test allowed a more accurate measure
of immediate performance since participants had four possible response options, the
presented foreground object is: ‘new’, ‘old originally paired with a negative encoding context’, ‘old originally paired with a neutral encoding context’, or ‘old but I can’t
remember the encoding context’. Data were analysed using the same method as in
Experiment 1.

3. Results
3.1. Experiment 1—overnight consolidation
3.1.1. Behaviour
Context memory was 77% correct (±SD 13%) at the immediate
test, and 61% correct (±SD 16%) following the offline consolidation
delay when data were pooled across negative and neutral items
and across tasks. This was significantly higher than chance (25%),
one-sample T-test p < 0.001 in both cases. Object recognition was
99.6% correct (±SD 16%) at the immediate test, and 92.3% correct
(±SD 10%), at the delayed test when data were pooled in the same
way. See Table 1(A) for further descriptives.
Performance at the immediate test prior to consolidation, was
equivalent in Sleep and Wake groups (Fig. 2A). A pair of 2 × 2 × 2
mixed ANOVAs modelling task (Emotion/People), encoding context

valence (negative/neutral), and participant group (Sleep/Wake)
showed no significant effects. Because there was no effect of
retrieval task on either context memory (F(20) = 0.68; p = 0.42) or
object recognition (F(20) = 0.71; p = 0.14) this factor was merged
within a 2 × 2 ANOVA of valence (negative/neutral) and group
(Sleep/Wake), but the merged ANOVA revealed no significant findings. Since the Sleep group encoded in the evening, while the Wake
group encoded in the morning, these null results suggest that time
of day had no significant impact upon encoding or immediate recall
in either context memory or object recognition.
To quantify the impact an off-line delay upon memory performance, we created a measure of forgetting which was calculated for
each participant as forgetting = immediate performance − delayed
performance (Payne et al., 2008). This was first examined using the
2 × 2 × 2 ANOVAs described above. Because there was no effect of
retrieval task on forgetting in either context memory (F(20) = 0.10;
p = 0.75) or object recognition (F(20) = 1.36; p = 0.72) the task factor was then merged within a 2 × 2 ANOVA as in the immediate
test (see above). In context memory, this merged ANOVA showed
that participants who slept overnight during the retention period
forgot less encoding contexts than participants who remained
awake (F(42) = 4.88; p = 0.03; Fig. 2B). There was also an effect of

Fig. 2. Behavioural performance on the context memory task. At the immediate test, the number of correctly attributed contexts (context memory) did not differ between
groups (Sleep/Wake), encoding valences (negative/neutral), or tasks (Emotion/People) in either Experiment 1 (A) or Experiment 2 (C). The number of contexts forgotten
across the retention interval (context forgetting) did, however, differ between groups. Participants who slept during the retention interval showed less context forgetting in
both Experiment 1 (B) and Experiment 2 (D). An asterisk (*) indicates significance at p < 0.05. Error bars show 1 SEM.

valence, with negative encoding contexts less likely to be forgotten
(F(42) = 5.87; p = 0.02), however there was no interaction between
sleep and valence (F(42) = .29; p = 0.59). The 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed
no significant effects on object recognition.
In summary, both context memory and object recognition were
equivalent for Sleep and Wake groups immediately before the
retention interval, indicating similar levels of memory at baseline
and showing that performance was not influenced by the time of
day of training or testing. At the subsequent delayed test however,
participants who had slept forgot less context information than
participants who had remained awake. There was no interaction
between emotional valence and this sleep-related modulation of
context forgetting.
3.1.2. Functional imaging
In the fMRI data, we first searched for regions of the episodic
memory system in which context retrieval responses differed

after consolidation across wake and sleep. Pooling the results of
contrast 1 [Sleep (context retrieval) < > Wake (context retrieval)]
across both Emotion and People tasks showed that the superior behavioural performance following sleep was associated with
enhanced responses in the left superior parietal cortex, and left hippocampus (to avoid performance confounds we considered only
correct context memory trials). This effect was amplified for the
Emotion task compared to the People task though direct comparison revealed no significant difference Table 2(A and B) and Fig. 3.
No area was more active in Wake than Sleep in any of the above
contrasts.
The interaction between emotional valence and retention type
(Sleep/Wakefulness) was examined using contrast 2. Valence
impacted on neural activity only when the task demanded explicit
recollection of context emotionality (Emotion task). No effect was
observed for the pooled Emotion and People tasks, nor for the People task alone, yet for the Emotion task greater responses were

observed in the Sleep group as compared to the Wake group
within five distinct regions. The strongest of these occurred in
right anterior parahippocampus, but significant responses were
also observed in left amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
posterior cingulate (abutting retrosplenial cortex), and precuneus,
Fig. 4A–D and Table 2(C). No area was more active in Wake than
Sleep in any of the above contrasts.
Altered connectivity between the hippocampal complex and
amygdala has been suggested to result from consolidation during
sleep (Hu et al., 2006; Wagner et al., 2005, 2006). To explore this
possibility in context memory, we applied a psychophysiological
interaction (PPI) analysis (Friston et al., 1997; Gitelman et al., 2003)
to examine functional coupling between our seed region and the
rest of the brain as a function of the interaction between sleep and
valence (see Section 2). We chose the right parahippocampus at
24/−16/−20 as a seed region because it showed a greater enhancement in response to the interaction (contrast 2) in the Emotion task
than any other brain area, see Table 2(C). Pooling Emotion and People tasks, we observed significantly greater functional connectivity
between this right parahippocampal seed and the bilateral amygdala/periamygdala in the Sleep group as compared to the Wake
group during correct attribution of valenced contexts, Fig. 4E and
Table 2(D). For the purpose of precise localisation, the PPI response
was overlaid on a probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maximum probability map (MPM) using the SPM Anatomy toolbox (Version
1.4, http://www.fz-juelich.de/ime/spm anatomy toolbox (Eickhoff
et al., 2005)). This assigned the left hemispheric response to basolateral amygdala with a probability of 60%, and the right hemispheric
response to amygdala with a probability of 100%. Neither separate analysis of Emotion and People nor direct comparison of these
conditions revealed significant findings. These results demonstrate
greater functional coupling between the parahippocampal and
amygdala regions during successful emotional memory retrieval
following overnight consolidation.
Overall our functional data show that the post-sleep reduction in
context forgetting is paralleled by stronger responses in hippocampus and superior parietal cortex at retrieval. Additionally, we show
stronger functional responses in the emotional memory system, as
well as increases in connectivity within that system, in association
with the interaction between sleep and valence.
3.2. Experiment 2—daytime napping
In order to confirm that the reduced forgetting observed after
sleep in Experiment 2 was not due to circadian differences between
the times at which Sleep and Wake groups were trained or tested,
we conducted Experiment 2 in which Wake and Nap groups were
trained and tested at the same time of day. These experimental
groups showed comparable performance at the immediate test, see
Table 1(B) for descriptives. A 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA with the between
subject factor participant group (Wake/Nap) and the within subject factor encoding context valence (negative/neutral) showed
no difference between groups in terms of either context memory
(Fig. 2C) or object recognition. There was a main effect of valence in
both measures, with negative encoding contexts remembered better than neutral encoding contexts (F(36) = 11.69; p = 0.002), and
foreground objects associated with a negative encoding context
remembered better than those associated with a neutral encoding
context (F(36) = 8.15; p = 0.007). There was also a significant interaction between group and valence in object recognition, with negatively associated foreground objects enjoying a greater advantage
in the Nap group than in the Wake group (F(36) = 4.33; p = 0.045).
As in Experiment 1, the impact of retention upon context
memory performance was quantified using forgetting (forgetting = immediate performance − delayed performance) (Payne
et al., 2008). The 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA described above indicated

that participants who slept during the retention period forgot
fewer encoding contexts than participants who remained awake
(F(36) = 5.51; p = 0.024) see Fig. 2D, however there was no main
effect of context valence (F(36) = 0.09; p = 0.77) and no interaction
between factors (F(36) = 0.02; p = 0.90). Analysis of object recognition revealed no significant findings.
To summarise results from Experiment 2, context memory
and object recognition were equivalent for Wake and Nap groups
immediately before the retention interval. After retention however, participants who slept forgot less contextual information
than participants who remained awake. This replicates the main
behavioural result of the Experiment 1 and, because there was no
difference in the diurnal times of training and testing for Wake and
Nap groups in Experiment 2, these findings greatly reduce the possibility that the results of Experiment 1 could have occurred due
to circadian factors, suggesting instead that they relate to sleep
obtained during the retention interval.
4. Discussion
We examined context memory retrieval after 12 h of consolidation across either daytime wake or overnight sleep. Our design
included both emotional and neutral encoding contexts, allowing examination of how encoding context valence interacts with
sleep-related consolidation. Our data show that context memory
decayed less across sleep than across wakefulness, and that superior post-sleep performance was linked to stronger responses in
the left hemispheric hippocampus and superior parietal cortex.
Interestingly, sleep protected emotional and neutral context memories to the same extent, though our fMRI data show a functional
interaction between context valence and sleep, with areas of the
emotional memory system significantly more activated, and more
strongly interconnected, during correct retrieval of negative encoding contexts post-sleep. This difference between functional and
behavioural results could be due to differences in the way sleep
impacts upon context and recognition memory—a full discussion
is provided below.
4.1. Main effect of overnight retention
Our data show significantly stronger responses in the hippocampus and superior parietal cortex during correct context retrieval
after a 12-h retention interval containing sleep compared to an
equivalent time period of daytime wakefulness (Fig. 2B). Because
these structures are core components of the episodic memory system, and because they are strongly linked to memory retrieval
(Cabeza, 2008; Cabeza, Ciaramelli, Olson, & Moscovitch, 2008) the
more robust functional responses observed post-sleep are very
likely associated with altered processing in that system. Importantly, these enhancements occurred irrespective of the emotionality of remembered information, and irrespective of retrieval task.
A number of prior studies have demonstrated enhanced hippocampal responses during memory retrieval or performance of
a learned skill after retention across sleep compared to retention
across natural wake (Albouy et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2005) or
overnight sleep deprivation (Gais et al., 2007; Sterpenich et al.,
2007, 2009). The current findings extend this literature to include
context memory. Because the hippocampus is critical for contextual binding (Davachi & Wagner, 2002; Giovanello, Verfaellie, &
Keane, 2003; Jackson & Schacter, 2004; Shoqeirat & Mayes, 1991)
our result could suggest that such responses are associated with
greater memory for contextual detail after retention across sleep
as compared to wake. Such effects are attributable either to passive
protection of memories, whereby hippocampal representations do
not decay as dramatically across sleep as they do across wakeful-

P.A. Lewis et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 2619–2629

ness, or to active enhancement of such representations by sleep,
see (Ellenbogen, Payne, & Stickgold, 2006).
Unlike the hippocampal response, the stronger activation we
observed in superior parietal cortex after sleep is most likely specific to the context memory task. Parietal cortex responds more
in context memory than in item-memory irrespective of whether
information is correctly retrieved (Dobbins, Foley, Schacter, &
Wagner, 2002; Dobbins, Rice, Wagner, & Schacter, 2003; Dobbins &
Wagner, 2005), and could therefore mediate attempts to remember
an encoding context instead of actual recollection of this context.
Two closely related models (Cabeza, 2008; Cabeza et al., 2008;
Ciaramelli, Grady, & Moscovitch, 2008; Ciaramelli, Grady, Levine,
Ween, & Moscovitch, 2010) propose that dorsal parietal cortex
is responsible for top-down direction of attention for mnemonic
search in difficult memory problems. Because sleep facilitates the
reorganisation of mnemonic representations, for instance by integrating new learning into existing knowledge (Dumay & Gaskell,
2007), forming generalised (Pace-Schott et al., 2009) or holistic
(Ellenbogen et al., 2006) representation of newly learned information, and downscaling of evoked EEG potentials to context memory
(Verleger, Ludwig, Kolev, Yordanova, & Wagner, 2011), the parietal
responses observed here could be associated with differences in
the way the memory for contextual information is organised or
accessed after sleep, with a resultant impact on memory search.
4.2. Interaction between overnight retention and valence
Based on the literature showing emotion-specific memory
enhancements after sleep (Hu et al., 2006; Nishida et al., 2009;
Payne et al., 2008; Payne & Kensinger, 2011; Sterpenich et al., 2007,
2009; Wagner et al., 2005, 2006) we expected to find an interaction
between sleep and valence, with sleep exerting a greater protective influence on memory for emotional contexts than for neutral
ones. Interestingly, our behavioural data did not follow this pattern. In both Experiments 1 and 2 we found less context forgetting
after sleep than after wake, but no interaction between this reduction and context valence. Because this result differs markedly from
the findings of tasks such as the Recollection/Familiarity paradigm
(Hu et al., 2006; Nishida et al., 2009) and tests of memory for
details in emotional texts (Wagner et al., 2005, 2006) or pictures
(Payne et al., 2008; Payne & Kensinger, 2011) it suggests that the
behavioural component of the context memory task does not probe
those aspects of emotional memory which are selectively facilitated
by sleep. Thus, while the prior literature (Payne et al., 2008; Payne
& Kensinger, 2011) suggests that memory for emotional details
embedded within learned images is enhanced by sleep, our data
show that the associative link between an emotional context and a
neutral foreground object is not strengthened in this way. This also
explains why our behavioural findings with respect to the influence
of sleep were equivalent for both explicitly emotional (Emotion
task) and implicitly emotional (People task) context memory, since
context emotionality did not interact with the influence of sleep in
either case.
A differential impact of sleep upon emotional context memory and emotional recall is in line with observations that the
sense of vividness evoked by emotional memory can be dissociated from memory for contextual details (Kensinger & Schacter,
2008; Sharot & Yonelinas, 2008). The specificity of the functional
interaction we observed between sleep and valence to the emotion
task (in which responses related to the emotionality of encoding
contexts) is in keeping with the possibility that sleep selectively
enhances memory for emotional details in the encoding context,
but not for the link between that context and the neutral foreground object. Thus the Emotion task may have triggered memory
for details about the emotional encoding context to a greater extent
than the People task (in which responses were not influenced by

2627

emotionality). A close match between the responses in left amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex which
were observed during emotional memory after sleep in the Emotion task, and those which responded to an equivalent contrast
in a recent study of how sleep impacts upon memory for emotional details in otherwise neutral pictures (Payne & Kensinger,
2011) further corroborates this account. Additionally, several elegant studies (Dolcos, LaBar, & Cabeza, 2005; Smith et al., 2006)
suggest a recursive relationship between amygdala and hippocampus during recollection, wherein hippocampus-mediated memory
retrieval enhances emotion-related responses in the amygdala,
and these emotion-related responses in turn stimulate memory
for further detail. The enhanced connectivity which we observed
between parahippocampus and bilateral amygdala provides a clear
link between this proposal and the current dataset.
Turning to our functional results, the current observations reinforce those of Payne and Kensinger (2011) by showing stronger
neural responses in parts of the emotional memory system, including left amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate
during emotional memory after sleep. Because the context memory paradigm is protected both against the confounding influence
of semantic interrelatedness among emotional stimuli (which can
lead to superior memory for emotional items), and against the
possibility that responses in the emotional system at test are
due to processing presented emotional stimuli rather than emotional memories, this new dataset eliminates any possibility that
the post-sleep enhancements observed by Payne and Kensinger
could have been associated with such confounding influences.
Interestingly, Payne and Kensinger (2011) observed no increase in
parahippocampal response, although they did observe heightened
connectivity between parahippocampus/fusiform and other parts
of the emotional memory system post-sleep. Because the parahippocampus mediates contextual associations (Bar et al., 2008), the
marked heightening in response which we observed here may be
task-specific.
4.3. Paradigm differences between Experiments 1 and 2
Experiments 1 and 2 differ not only in that Experiment 1 used
overnight consolidation while Experiment 2 used daytime napping, but also in that the immediate test was performed only once,
and without feedback, in Experiment 2, while it was performed
twice with feedback in Experiment 1. The fact that Experiment
2 revealed a sleep-related reduction in context forgetting despite
these differences shows that the initial finding could not have been
associated with the repetitive encoding in Experiment 1. Interestingly, although the main effect of sleep was conserved across
experiments, Experiment 2 showed a significant effect of encoding
context valence during the immediate test which was not apparent
in Experiment 1. This is likely associated with differences in encoding tasks as participants in Experiment 2 rated contextual stimuli
for valence and arousal during training, leading to deeper encoding
which likely impacted upon subsequent emotional memory.
4.4. Brain state during retention
Our observation of less context forgetting across a 12-h retention interval containing sleep than across an equivalent time period
of daytime wakefulness (Fig. 2B) reinforces a growing literature
suggesting that aspects of declarative memory are strengthened,
or preferentially maintained, across sleep, see (Born, Rasch, & Gais,
2006; Walker, 2009) for reviews. Some authors speculate that elements of sleep physiology such as slow waves and sleep spindles
may play an active role in consolidation (Born et al., 2006; Walker,
2009), while others maintain that the reduced forgetting observed
across sleep is due to the relative absence of interfering stimuli see

2628

P.A. Lewis et al. / Neuropsychologia 49 (2011) 2619–2629

(Ellenbogen et al., 2006) for both sides of the argument. Both possibilities are relevant to the current study, in which the Wake group
spent the retention interval going about their normal daily activities, while the Sleep group obtained an average of 7.7 h of sleep
in Experiment 1, and 1.5 h of sleep in Experiment 2. Although we
cannot specifically determine the extent to which waking activities may have disrupted consolidation, previous work addressing
this in skill learning (Huber et al., 2006; Mednick, Nakayama, &
Stickgold, 2003; Walker, Brakefield, Morgan, Hobson, & Stickgold,
2002) and integration of declarative information (Cai, Mednick,
Harrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009) describes performance deficits,
rather than enhancements, when daytime activities are reduced
or completely blocked to mimic the behavioural quiescence
of sleep.
In addition to differences in activity levels, and in amounts of
sleep obtained during the retention interval, the Sleep and Wake
groups in Experiment 1 also differed in the diurnal time at which
they performed the memory tasks. Specifically, the Sleep group
was tested and scanned at approximately 9 AM, while the Wake
group was tested and scanned at approximately 9 PM. This means
that the results of Experiment 1 could potentially be due to circadian variations in physiology, rather than to sleep during the
retention interval. We examined this possibility at the behavioural
level by comparing performance on the immediate test (completed prior to consolidation) in the AM (Wake group) and the
PM (Sleep group) and found no significant difference (F = 0.334,
p = 0.57). Because the number of correctly attributed contexts was
equivalent at these two times of day before consolidation (Fig. 2A),
it is unlikely that the differential forgetting observed for Wake and
Sleep groups was due to circadian influences on retrieval. Instead,
such differences are more likely linked to differential consolidation during retention across these day or nighttimes intervals. To
control for the possibility that such consolidation was associated
with circadian characteristics of the retention period rather than
with sleep itself, we repeated the behavioural component of this
study using a napping paradigm in which all participants were
trained at 11 AM and tested at 4 PM, but the Sleep group enjoyed
a nap of approximately 90 min during the retention interval (see
Fig. 2C and D). Our findings replicated the main-effect of sleep
upon context memory as reported in the main study, Fig. 2B, and
therefore reduce concern that this could have been due to circadian
factors alone.
Turning to the functional data, our fMRI analysis was carefully
designed to control for circadian effects where possible. We used
a two tiered interaction in which items in the same experimental session were compared with each other prior to comparisons
between Sleep and Wake groups. This meant that any responses
associated with performing the task at a specific time of day were
subtracted from the data ([context memory > correct rejections] for
contrast 1 and [negative context memory > neutral context memory] for contrast 2) before Sleep and Wake groups were compared,
ensuring that neural activities relating to the time of day were
disambiguated from those relating to the difference between consolidation across sleep and wake. Furthermore, the interaction
we observed between functional enhancement and task, whereby
parts of the episodic memory system and amygdala were only activated in the Emotion task, but not in the People task (see Fig. 4),
argues against a circadian explanation for our findings since diurnal effects would have to be task-specific in order to produce this
pattern. Despite these efforts, we cannot completely rule out the
possibility that a three way interaction between stimulus valence,
retrieval task, and time of day may have contributed to the functional results. Future work should combine napping paradigms,
sleep recording with polysomnography, and fMRI to verify that
the observed alterations in brain activity are truly associated
with sleep.

4.5. Summary
Overall, our data show that context memory decays less across
an overnight retention interval containing sleep than across an
equivalent interval of daytime wakefulness, and that this better
memory for the context in which a stimulus was first seen is associated with stronger responses in the hippocampus and superior
parietal cortex. Interestingly, the emotional content of contextual
memories did not interact with this reduction in forgetting at the
level of behavioural performance, suggesting that the selective
impact of sleep upon memory for emotional information reported
in prior studies (Hu et al., 2006; Nishida et al., 2009; Payne et al.,
2008; Payne & Kensinger, 2011; Sterpenich et al., 2007, 2009;
Wagner et al., 2005, 2006) may be limited to memory for the emotional image itself, or for detail within that image, and may not
extend to the link between that image and associated information.
Future work should establish the role of sleep physiology in the
overnight protection of contextual memories and explicitly test for
differences in how it impacts on emotional recognition and emotional context memory.
