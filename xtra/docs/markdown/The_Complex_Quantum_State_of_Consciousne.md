The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness

Abstract: We introduce a series of new energy sources SU(6), SU(12), SU(24),……….∞. We consider an
earlier stages of quantum physics of the super unified group SU(11) which created two distinct character’s
energy group SU(6) & SU(5)by the symmetry breaking of SU(11) ) [  SU(6)  SU(5)  U(1)]of the 10dimensional space-time beyond the standard model of physics. The extra-dimensions are associated with the
mental i.e. we consider the individual mind is (partly) an expression of the universal mind. Again the 4dimensional Einstein’s space-time obtained from the symmetry breaking of the Unified Gaussian energy group
SU(5)[  SU(3)  SU(2)L  U(1)]. That earlier stages that means in the Super Unified Gaussian Group SU(11)
having quark-like particles together strong forces of SU(6) formed conscious particles that means elements-like
of the wave characters and with lepton-like particles by the weak forces of SU(5)[we assumed that in the first
stage SU(6) creates strong forces while SU(5) creates weak forces] introduces a new dimensions of physics. In
the second stage, the atoms of the material elements of our physical universe constructed by the quarks with the
strong forces SU(3), weak forces SU(2), and electrodynamics U(1) with respect to the conscious particles or
atom-like/element-like energy particles of the first stage. The new energy sources SU(6) is responsible for
different kinds of intelligence/consciousness within our material/physical universe as well as the elements which
produces life with the formation of biological particles etc. with the re-arrangement of the different kinds of
simple & compound chemical elements. Different types of matter elements in our physical universe formed by
increasing the number of electrons i.e. atomic numbers and then compound elements are found by the chemical
reaction, also which was controlled by SU(6). The energy particles of the stage of SU(11) are always in the form
of waves, while particles of the stage of SU(5)maintaining the law of wave-particle duality called entanglement.
Thus in our physical/objective universe, the consciousness energies and physical energies are always behaving
like entanglement. Consciousness/intelligence frequently changes mainly due to the randomly superposition of
the wave functions. In the theory of SU(11), it is possible to change any of 30(thirty) latent energy bosons of
SU(6) into any of the 30(thirty) matter energy bosons of SU(5) or vice-versa by the exchange of the J-bosons of
SU(11). So, at this stage, by the symmetry breaking of SU(11) created an amount of pre-matter energy/exotic
matter fluids by exchanging the J-bosons of SU(11). It is assumed that in the first stage, quark-like particles of
u, d,..…etc. are 5-times or otherwise 5-different types of each u, d…..etc. that of the quarks of the unified energy
groups of SU(5), the standard model of physics. The strong latent energy groups SU(6) produces different kinds
of conscious elements after transferring the exotic matter fluids into ordinary matter fluids and producing
biological cells, after then SU(6) responsible for the biological consciousness and the sum of the biological
consciousness created an individual identity, a complete individual identity means like a human/a single
animal/a single plant etc. as like as an element/compound element/atom/molecule etc., in the large scales a
cluster/galaxy/star/planet etc. Thus there exists a dualism of an energy waves produces in first stages with
SU(6) and material-like with SU(5). The symmetry breaking of the energy group of SU(5) then belongs to the
sub-systems only. By the suitable arrangement of the u, d,…. etc. of quark-like particles with SU(6), build
different kinds of conscious atom-like elements which produces the basic properties of consciousness of the
universe and as well as for live elements including human. Therefore, SU(6) behaves like a programmer created
a blue-print of the whole universe/galaxy within the black hole/live body within the DNA etc. and then stays in
the neighborhood of the material/biological elements as a field. The creation of different carbon based live
bodies etc. and their identities depend on an amount of resultant/sum total consciousness with respect to the
material elements of the live bodies where consciousness arises, as require as possible and also depend on the
situations & positions of the place of creation of the live body within the universe [in our earth naturally,
human, any animal, plant etc of the carbon based live bodies created within a biological temperature. Thus in
another place other than earth within the universe like earth, it may be possible to create live bodies like us or
otherwise may create live bodies are based on silicon or other matter ( here silicon and carbon belongs to the
same group of the periodic table of chemistry) within a require temperature because consciousness might be at
some point arise in silicon or other matter]. Those two stages mentioned above may be assumed like the state of
vapor & liquid of the same water i.e. we compared with the character of water which is different from the
characters of hydrogen & oxygen, that means from the symmetry breaking of the super-unified group SU(11),
we get two distinct characters identity as consciousness or spirit & physical matter. In the first stage, the energy
waves cannot collapse into visible material-like particles but we can assume as pseudo particle while in the

second stage wave function may be collapsed into particles by the superposition of the energy waves.
Quark/Quark-like particles produces electrons and also in the neighborhood of a bunch of individual neuron
created free electrons by the residue /excess [according to the requirements of fulfillments] energies which play
with electromagnetic forces throughout the inner and outer section of a human body and other live bodies. The
energy group SU(6) having five neutral bosons out of 35-bosons, one neutral boson created a strong neutral
current by the electromagnetic interaction with U(1)[i.e. in the frame-work SU(6)U(1)] [which was explained
at CERN, ‘the flavor changing neutral current’] as like as created, the weak neutral current of SU(2) with U(1)
in the frame-work of SU(2)U(1). We consider an electromagnetic interaction created by SU(6) & SU(2) with
U(1) are also caused for different effectiveness of the consciousness, intelligence, emotions and any kind of
electromagnetic interactions etc. & the movements of biological free electrons throughout the human body or
any other live-body or between live and inanimate objects. So we can assume that like God with consciousness
of the soul energy of the universe on the first stage created our real material universe of the second stage
including all lives called physical stuff and stayed within us till to the back to the stage of the Grand Super
Unified Group SU(23) beyond 10-dimensional space-time. Hence the consciousness or soul energy never
diminished and stayed within our atmosphere with pseudo-activeness called spirit stuff.

Introduction

The human brain and its mental aspects are associated with classical brain physiology and are also part
of a quantum physical universe. We consider the whole universe being multi-dimensional. We consider the
universe having (4+D)–dimensional Friedmann–Robertson–Walker type universe having complex scale factor R
+ iRI, where R is the scale factor corresponding to the usual 4–dimensional Universe while iRI is that of D–
dimensional space-time. It was shown mathematically that when D = 6 (i.e. 4 + 6 = 10- dimensions), RI = R and
then real/physical universe actually starts. With respect to the quantum theory, it was shown that our universe
started with the symmetry breaking of the Gaussian energy group SU(11). We may consider that the extradimensions ‗D‘ are associated with a mental or that of the individual mind is (partly) an expression of a
universal mind through holonomic communication with quantum fields. This was proposed by the Pribram
1986, 2011, in his holographic (holonomic) theories. The human brain conceived as an interfacing organ that not
only produces mind and consciousness but also receives information. The brain or parts of the brain are
conceived as an interference hologram of incoming data and already existing data (a ―personal universe‖) which
equivalent to the subject‘s memory. If properly exposed (―analyzed‖), information about the outer world can be
distilled where ―analyzer‖ is cerebral electrophysiology. Again ―Bohm‖ hypothesized that additional dimensions
(i.e. extra-dimensions) are necessary to describe QM interference processes, thereby circumventing probabilistic
theories and consciousness-induced collapse of the wave function. According to this theory, assumed that the
universe is a giant superposition of waves, representing an unbroken wholeness, of which the human brain is a
part (Bohm, 1990). Accordingly, the individual mind or consciousness is an inherent property of all matter (and
energy), and as such being part, or rather an expression, of this universal quantum field, the apparently diffuse
time/space localization of mental functions argues in favor of an underlying multidimensional space/time
reality.
Quantum theory describes the fundamental level of energy and matter, such as mass, charge and spin
that are given properties of the universe, not capable of further reduction or explanation. In quantum theories of
consciousness, it is suggested that consciousness is such a fundamental property existing at this level. Some
theories are additionally linked to the structure of space time, such as the smooth continuous curvature of space
that describes gravity in general relativity is incompatible with the discreteness of particles/waves that is
fundamental to quantum theory. But it was shown in my article ―The Complex Model of The Quantum
Universe‖, IOSR-JM, ISSN: 2278-5728. Volume 4,Issue 1(Nov. - Dec. 2012), PP 20-33, www. iosrjournals.org.
the energy densities of the two phases are directly proportional [i.e. ε1 (t)  (t)] which indicates that the large or
small matter energy density in the vapor phase (so called nothing) changes to the large or small matter energy
density in the liquid phase (Einstein‘s 4-dimensional universe) and hence it is found, an important fact, that the
existence of discrete structure in the universe, ranging from galaxies to superclusters. Again classical physics
comprises only so-called billiard ball relationships, with bits of matter and energy bumping into one another.
These relationships are local, in that they involve immediate contact. Such relationships are also normal in
quantum physics. Non locality is the remaining special feature of quantum theory. This applies only where two
particles have been in some close relationship, such as two electrons in the same orbital. In very recent
experimentally proved that it is possible such as two electrons remain in the same orbital. In this case they can
become correlated. For instance the spins of two particles are in a wave form, as both will be in a superposition
of up and down. However, if the wave function of one particle collapses, that particle chooses one or the other
superposition. When that happens, the other particle will choose the opposite position. It was shown
experimentally by Thomas A;‖ For a basic introduction to QM‖. This happened when two particles are out of
range of a signal travelling at the speed of light. No matter, energy or conventional information is transferred,

and the experiment is not regarded as a violation of relativity, but it is demonstrated that quantum properties can
correlate instantaneously over any distance.
The concept implies entanglement (non locality) means the apparently diffuse time space localization
of mental functions argues in favor of an underlying multidimensional space-time reality. So that the
Potential energy to couple wave information to mental processes, proposes that wave information is
transmitted from and into the brain by wave resonance. According to Vattay et al. 2012; Hagan et al. 2002.The
quantum system (of the brain) interacts with a quantum environment, the phase information is lost and cannot be
reassembled. By entanglement, the quantum coherence in a small region, e.g. the cell or the brain, might have
spatial long-range effects.

Consciousness Studies of 20 th Century

The traditional explanation for consciousness or the soul is known as dualism, i.e. a separate spirit stuff
and physical stuff, with the spirit stuff capable of acting on the physical stuff, as when the soul commands the
body. Again the study of emotions being largely prescribed, with brains conceived as being reasoning machines
and nothing else. But the failure of dualism is one of the few points that identify consciousness with a
fundamental of the universe (Thompson, 2000). In the 1990s, the dominant explanation for consciousness is
driven by the success of computers as problem solving and memory storage machines. The main proposal is that
any system or machine that processes information in the same way as the brain will be conscious, regardless of
what it is made of. But it does not explain how consciousness arises in the brain and nor does it explain how
consciousness might be at some point arise in silicon or other matter. It is very interesting point that carbon is an
essential element for the building of live body or human body etc. and it is clear that carbon & silicon lying in
the same group of the periodic table of chemistry. So, as consciousness arises in the brain of human or lives in a
biological temperature which was made on the basis of carbon, then it is possible that consciousness may arise
at some point if there any creation of lives/anything is made on the basis of silicon within the required
temperature. The most popular ―Identity Theory‖ declared that consciousness was identical to the brain or
identical to its processing. However, it explain why it was identical to the brain, but not to any of the other
physical structures in the universe. Nor did it attempt to define what it meant by the brain, despite the fact that
our understanding of the physical processing of the brain was changing dramatically. It was further undermined
by the discovery that much neural processing such as the dorsal stream governing spontaneous movement could
be brought to completion outside of consciousness, which was seen to be more closely related to longer-term
evaluations and planning.
The next popular idea of consciousness was the Epiphenomenalism. The theory proposes that
consciousness is a by-product of neural processing that has, however, no function. Which conflicts with
evolutionary theory in that it is hard to see why evolution should select for something that had no function,
particularly as neural processing is exceptionally energy-hungry. The theory also conflicts head on with physics
in which there is no causality, with every object or process having influences elsewhere and finally functionless
by-product, there is still no physical evidence for what produces such a thing in the brain. In the present century,
it now accepted that mental events could influence the body and that visceral events could feed back on the
brain. It also accepted that emotion is a relevant aspect of mental life. However, there was an over-reach in
suggesting that the body somehow drove consciousness that the brain could not produce. This seemed to assume
some kind of undefined special property in the body that was not present in the brain. More specifically it
ignored the fact apart from the sense of touch signals entered the brain directly from the environment and were
consciously processed in the higher sensory and frontal cortex before being signaled to the viscera. A popular
concept of consciousness is an emergent property. Emergence is a familiar process in physics. Liquidity is an
emergent property of water. The individual component hydrogen and oxygen atoms do not have the property of
liquidity. However, when they are bound together in a sufficiently large number of water molecules, the
property of liquidity emerges. The energy particles in the symmetry of SU(11), can be compared with
emergence theory make a change after symmetry breaking into SU(6), SU(5),฀ U(1) with dualism, where spirit
stuff is due to SU(6) and physical stuff is due to SU(5). The spirit stuff of consciousness (including intelligence)
is due to SU(6) formed mass body with SU(5) [having the component as strong force SU(3), weak force SU(2)],
and electrodynamics U(1) with fermions. Thus quanta of SU(11), is divided into two main classes like physical
stuff and spirit stuff which possesses mass & soul in our real/physical universe and then gradually consciousness
will be objective with intelligences etc. according to the liquidation of the universe. According to Murphy,
2007, 2011, Auletta et al, Clayton and Davies, 2006, anybody who thinks that consciousness is an emergent
property is possible in physics could simplify their search for consciousness by accepting the idea of dualistic
spirits. Quanta are unlike any particles or objects that are encountered in the large scale world. When isolated
from their environment they are conceived as having the property of waves, but when they are brought into
contact with the environment, there is a process of de-coherence, in which the wave function is described as
collapsing into a particle. The wave form of the quanta of SU(11) is different from waves in matter of SU(5) in

the large scale world, such as the familiar waves in the sea. These involve energy passing through matter. By
contrast, the quantum wave can be viewed as a wave of the probability for finding a particle in a specific
position. This probability wave also applies to states of the quanta such as momentum. While the quanta remain
in its wave form, it is viewed as a superposition of all the possible positions that the particle could occupy. At
the peak of the wave, where the amplitude is greatest, there is the highest probability of finding a particle, when
the wave eventually collapses. However, the choice of position for each individual particle is completely
random, representing an effect without a cause.

Appearance of Our Universe

There is no consensus yet on how the universe initially came to be, the general assumption is that
perhaps an energetic fluctuation caused the universe to tunnel into the existence from quantum foam. The
question of why the large energy of the universe is in a dark, i.e. not found in practical, the observed vacuum
energy is so small in comparison to the scales of particle physics is known as cosmological constant problem. It
is generally thought to be easier to imagine an unknown mechanism which would set vacuum parameter exactly
to zero and so it can be considered that there exist several unifications from the very early universe. This class of
symmetry group can be expressed mathematically as SU(11)  SU (5)  SU( 6)  U(1); SU (23)  SU (12) 
SU (11) U (1); SU (47)  SU(24)  SU (23)  U (1); ...........so on. We can assume SU(5) as matter energy
group and SU(6) a new type of energy sources may be called as latent energy group together which changes into
the energy group SU(11) [similarly, apply for SU(23); SU(47) etc.], i.e. to the super unified group. So, it is
considered that the breakdown of SUT (Super Unified Theory) symmetry group SU(11), breaks into
fundamental group SU (5)  SU( 6) leads to a phase transition and then the fundamental group SU(5) which also
breaks into subgroups SU (3) SU( 2)  U(1), in which the scalar field Φ changes. The original vacuum, i.e.
false vacuum (Φ = σ) is no longer the true vacuum (Φ = 0). The inflationary stage arises, however, if the true
vacuum is not immediately attained. It can explain how the universe appears from nothing. It seems our universe
comes from nothing to the universe belongs to the energy group SU(11), a special unitary group having 11  11
matrices, such that SU(11)  SU (5)  SU( 6)  U(1). Thus, we have from SU(11), the Hermitian matrix H has
120 arbitrary constants. Which correspond to 120 bosons that now mediate between the different basic entities,
of these we already have 60-bosons from the matter energy group SU(5), latent energy group SU(6) and from
U(1). Thus, 120 – (24 + 35 + 1) = 60 more bosons are namely J-bosons are expected to link the participants of
SU(6) with SU(5). Therefore, in the theory of SU(11), it is possible to change any of 30 (thirty) latent energy
bosons of SU(6) into any of the 30(thirty) matter energy bosons of SU(5) or vice-versa by the exchange of the Jboson. That is why it becomes possible to create or destroy matter particles and hence the universe seems to
appear from nothing. In the present dissertation there is neither any starting point nor any ending point of the
wider (measurable in quantum cosmology) universe (i.e. complex space-time). Only there exists the initial and
end conditions for narrower (measurable classically) universe (i.e. Einstein space-time) which emerged from
wider universe by the process of changing phase, where it is a continuous process. Again, on the other-hand, the
idea that our 4-dimensional universe might have emerged from a higher dimensional space-time is now
receiving much attention where the compactification of higher dimensions plays a key role. However, the
question arises of how and why this compactification occurs. From string theory we know that the
compactification may take place provided that the higher dimensional manifold admits special properties,
namely if the geometry of the manifold allows, for example, the existence of a suitable killing vector. However,
it is difficult to understand why such manifolds are preferred and whether other possible mechanisms for
compactification do exist. In cosmology, on the other-hand, different kinds of compactification could be
considered. For example, in an approach, called dynamical compactification, the extra-dimensions evolve in
time towards very small sizes and the extra dimensional universe reduces to an effective 4-dimensional one.
This type of compactification was considered in my previous published paper [„The complex model of the
universe‟ of IOSR-JM, vol.2, 4 (2012), pp-41] with the help of Modern Kaluza-Klein theories. It is then a
natural question that how an effective four dimensional universe evolve in time and whether the resulting
cosmology is similar to the standard FRW four dimensional without extra dimensions. A universe is based on
the considerations of dark energy sector. One may start from a fundamental theory including both gravity and
standard model of particle physics. In this regard it is interesting to begin with 10 (= 4 + 6)-dimensional spacetime, in which case one needs a compactification of 10-dimensional super gravity theory where an effective 4dimensional undergoes acceleration. However, it has been known for some-time that it is difficult to derive such
a cosmology and has been considered that there is a no-go theorem that excludes such a possibility, if one takes
the internal space to be time-independent and compact without boundary. However, it has recently been shown
that one may avoid this no-go theorem by giving up the condition of time-independence of the internal space,
and a solution of the vacuum Einstein equations with compact hyperbolic internal space has been proposed
based on this model. Similar accelerating cosmologies can also obtain for SM 2 and SD 2 branes, not only for
hyperbolic but also for flat internal space. On the other-hand, from cosmological point of view it is not so

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
difficult to find cosmological models in which the 4-dimensional universe undergoes an accelerating expansion
and the internal space contracts with time, exhibiting the dynamical compactification. In my paper we consider
the internal space as imaginary (pseudo-space, b = iR), where the matter belongs to another phase by the phase
transition process with the help of the latent group SU(6). It is shown that using a more general metric and
introducing matter without specifying its nature, the size of compact space evolves as an inverse power of the
radius of the universe. The FRW equations of the standard four dimensional cosmology is obtained using an
effective pressures expressed in-terms of the components of the higher dimensional energy-momentum tensor
and the negative value of this pressure may explain the acceleration of our present universe. One of the recent
important cosmological observations is the accelerated expansion of the universe. It is known from the recent
distance measurement of type Ia supernova suggest strongly an accelerating universe. This accelerating
expansion is generally believed to be driven by an energy source called dark energy which provides negative
pressure, such as a positive cosmological constant, or a slowly evolving real scalar field called quintessence.
Moreover, the basic conclusion from all previous observations that 70 percent of the energy density of the
universe is in a dark energy sector, has been confirmed after the recent WMAP. That means the matter content
of the universe is composed of 70 percent of an unclustered component of negative pressure (dark energy) and
30 percent of a clustered component of zero pressure (cold dark matter).The traditional candidate of dark energy
are the cosmological constant,  and quintessence. But, these approaches have some serious drawbacks from
fundamental point of view. In fact, the observed energy density of the cosmological constant has a discrepancy
of about 120 orders of magnitude with the theoretically predicted value from field theory models. In the present
dissertation, we consider in the very early universe up-to the Big-Rip singularity, there were several
unifications. This class of symmetry group can be expressed mathematically as follows: SU (11)  SU (6)  SU
(5)  U (1); SU (23)  SU (12)  SU (11)  U (1); SU(47)  SU (24)  SU (23)  U (1);............so on. Thus we
have, SU (12n-1)  SU (6n)  SU (6n-1)  U (1), where, n = 𝟐𝟎 , 𝟐𝟏 , 𝟐𝟐 , 𝟐𝟑 , 𝟐𝟒 ,...........∞.i.e. SU (12n-1)  SU
(6n) ................ SU(24)  SU(12)  SU(6)  SU (3)  SU (2)  U (1). Hence, according to the law of
symmetry breaking of the energy group, i.e. according to the symmetry breaking of the Gaussian energy group,
there exists neither any Big-Bang nor any Big-Crunch singularity, only there Big-Rip singularity and Big-Break
singularity. All the dark energies SU(12), SU(24), ...... etc. Are also responsible for the various consciousness
and intelligence of the living cells or bodies according to the progress for biological revolution as such the
progress of the material universe depends on the sub-energy groups of SU (5)  SU(3)  SU(2)  U(1) stated by
the standard model of physics. Again the activities of the energy groups for consciousness are restricted to
unfold for each galaxy of the universe as well as for every solar system of the galaxies. Our physical universe,
starts from SU(11), classically from 10-dimensional space-time, the super-symmetry of the universe. The
quantum wave energy universe actually starts from Big-Rip singularity it was shown there exists energy
pressure and densities simultaneously. Most probably, 28% or 30% of the total energy (measuring by W-MAP)
were found for the symmetry breaking of the energy group SU(11) and rest 72% or 70% of the energy belongs
to another phase (according to the classical mathematics which are folded) starting from Big-Rip singularity due
to symmetry breaking of SU(23), SU(47), .........∞.

IV.

Double Slit Experiments

The physicist Richard Feynman said that this classic experiment contained all the problems of quantum
theory. In the early nineteenth century, an experiment by Thomas Young showed that when a light source shone
through two slits in a screen, and then onto a further screen, then a pattern of light and dark bands appeared on a
further screen, indicating that the light was in some places intensified and in other reduced or eliminated. Later,
the experiment was refined. Now be performed with one or two slits open. If there was only one slit open, the
photons or light quanta, or any other quanta used in the experiment behaved like particles. They passed through
the one open slit, interacted with the screen beyond and left an accumulation of marks on that screen, signifying
a shower of particles rather than a wave. But once the second slit was opened, the traditional interference
pattern, indicating interaction between two waves, reappeared on the screen. The ability to generate the behavior
of either particles or waves, simply according to how the experiment was set up, showed that the quanta had a
perplexing wave/particle duality. What is remarkable is that with two slits open, but the photons impacting one
at a time, the pattern on the screen formed itself into the light and dark bands of an interference pattern.
Somehow the photons ‗knew‘ to arrange themselves into a pattern indicative on the interaction of waves. The
question arose as to how the photons emitted later in time ‗knew‘ how to arrange themselves relative to the
earlier photons in such a way that there was a pattern of light and dark bands, indicative of interacting waves.
For the solution of the above problem, we need a new concept about quantum theory, as well as locality and
non-locality which hinges by the EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen) experiment. Locality comprises the idea
of normal cause and the effect under which objects or particles move or change as a result of being impacted by
other objects or particles, or of being directly acted on by energetic forces such as the electromagnetic force.
The non-locality involves the ability of one particle to determine the behavior of another distant particle

instantaneously, and without any matter or energy passing between the two. Einstein termed this ‗spooky action
at a distance‘.
It may be explained by a series of new energy sources SU(6), SU(12), ….etc. which may be established
the concepts of reality or objective existence of the above mentioned experimental theorem. Some of the new
energy sources exist which are not being observed by an observer practically. Our 4-dimensional matter/particle
universe or physical universe observed when there was created a ―whole‖, like single slit open i.e. by the
symmetry breaking of the unified group SU(5) and creates a shower of photons & quanta of the matter particles
on the natural screen of the universe or otherwise like double slits open from the 10-dimensional space-times
photons & quanta by the new energy sources of SU(6) emitted as ‗knew‘ [i.e. the symmetry breaking of the
super-unified energy group SU(11) and then SU(5)], we found an entangled-like matter energy with spirit
energy. It was compared with a situation of the universe where relatively very lower energy density in the ocean
of the new energy sources in one phase, starting from Big-Rip singularity like as in the gaseous phase and then
vapor & liquid phase. Again the Copenhagen Interpretation of Neils Bohr denies that sort of reality to the wave
form of the quanta. It is observed from the Einstein‘s space-time theory, that means we have from the
Friedmann equation for the evolution of the cosmic scale factor R(t) which represents the size of the universe, is
found at a finite time in the past R must have been equal to zero. Then the contents of all the galaxies must have
once been squeezed together in a small volume i.e. numerically, the volume of the matter universe once been
squeezed in a zero volume. We may assume that the matter universe is then transferred into another phase by the
phase transition system with the help of latent energy group SU(6) [SU(11)  SU(5)  SU(6)  U(1)]. The
subgroup SU(6) has been interpreted as a new type of energy sources other than SU(5) [SU(5)  SU(3)  SU(2)
 U(1)], the standard model of physics. So there were several environmental atmosphere according to the
unified group SU(11), SU(23)….∞ etc. all belonged to so called ―nothing‖ as said by Einstein. By the last
environmental situation produces quanta by the symmetry breaking of the unified energy group SU(5) and
formed our physical universe. Each and every environmental situation is formed by the different quanta with the
energy sources SU(6), SU(12),….etc. and effect the next generated quanta within their individual environment
by the process like wave function collapses. For example we compared the symmetry groups SU(5), SU(11),
SU(23),…etc . like with liquid, vapour, and gases states of matter. We assumed that our universe appeared from
something instead of nothing. It was discussed in my article ‗The Complex Quantum and Classical PseudoTachyonic Universe‘ [IOSR Journal of Mathematics (IOSR-JM) e-ISSN: 2278-5728, p-ISSN: 2319-765X,
Volume 8, Issue 3(Sep. -Oct. 2013), PP 15-32] that the quantum behaviour having some classical counterpart
that can always choose such a quantum state, which does not disappear at any value of RI, which guarantees the
positivity of the quantum average of the operator. Coming back to our cosmological model we can say that the
requirements of the well-definiteness of the pseudo-tachyonic part of the Hamiltonian operator in the WheelerDeWitt equation, does not imply the disappearance of the wave function of the universe at some values of the
variables and thus, does not reveal the effect of the quantum avoidance of the cosmological singularity.
The strength of weak force gradually decreases and strength of strong force increases as we advanced
from the symmetry breaking of the unified group SU(5). The first stage of the formation of our universe from so
called nothing which was basically from non-locality to locality by the symmetry breaking of the SUT group
SU(11), where the energy group SU(6) remains latent and behaves like as consciousness relative to the energy
group SU(5). The bosons of the energy group SU(6) always controlled all measurable energies of SU(5)
including ‗quarks‘ & ‗leptons‘ etc., which comes from pure energy stays in the form like vapor (i.e. in another
phase) and hence from the symmetry breaking of SU(11) with the energy group SU(12), we found new types of
quanta with conscious energy, quark-like, & lepton-like particles etc. and specially produces a strong neutral
current which are applicable within ‗live‘ cells /elements/animals/plants etc. with an electromagnetic interaction
created by SU(6) with U(1) in the frame-work of SU(6)  U(1) etc. called spirit stuff, and then from SU(5) are
found matter energies, fermions, charge particles, spin, etc. like the decomposes of water by applying electric
charges (extra energy) connecting with an electric circuit, we get hydrogen, oxygen as charged particles
primarily and then gases with different characters from the characters of water. But the two gases may again
react with each other at some situation and get water having no characters either of Hydrogen or Oxygen. It is
very interesting that the generated hydrogen and oxygen from water can be reacted with other chemical
elements in the some situations and found different characters in different forms. So, we consider, there exists
two phases of the universe, (1) local, that means, particle produces as per requirement of the second phase i.e. as
per the requirements of our universe which maintain the law of wave-particle duality theorem (physical stuff)
and (2) non local, i.e. particles in the wave form (called spirit), produces in the first phase of our universe which
controlled the second phase, our physical universe.
All the symmetry breakings from infinite space-time [i.e. Big-Rip singularity] to SU(5) belongs to the
phase (like gaseous & vapor), pseudo-tachyonic & tachyonic universe. Hence all the energy groups from
infinites dominantly effects ourselves while the energy group SU(6) directly controls the whole universe
including ourselves creating as consciousness or intelligence and creating others, like emotions etc. and with the

collaboration of atoms formed by the energy group of SU(5) produces biological particles. So, by the collapses
of quanta with the strong forces of SU(6) within the environmental situations of SU(11) where 30-bosons of
SU(6) changes to the 30-bosons of SU(5) or vice-versa, unfolded the physical universe and then we found
everything of our universe. It is a continuous process from infinitely discrete universe. In recent decades, decoherence has become particularly popular as a substitute instead of the traditional ‗measurement‘ which always
referred to in the Copenhagen version. In de-coherence, the collapse of the wave function happens of its own
accord, as a result of the wave becoming entangled with the rest of the environment. In some recent versions, it
is suggested that there is no collapse, the information in the wave simply gets lost in the larger scale
environment and a branching of reality into separate universes. So in the Schrodinger cat paradox, for instance,
the universe splits into one universe with a live cat and one with a dead cat.
The success of the above new quantum explanation emphasized three problematic solutions of quantum
theory, a causality in the randomness of the wave function collapse, a causality in the non-local influences
demonstrated by EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen) type experiments and the resulting of agreement as to the
underlying reality of the physical universe. So, at the quantum level, we find the sufficient cause of formation
the properties of mass, charge and spin that are given properties of the universe.
Again, we consider a (4+D)–dimensional Friedmann–Robertson–Walker type universe having complex
scale factor R + iRI where R is the scale factor corresponding to the usual 4–dimensional Universe while RI is
that of D-dimensional space. It is then compared with (4 + D)–dimensional Kaluza–Klein Cosmology having
two scale factors R and a (= iRI). It is shown that the rate of compactification of higher dimension depends on
extra dimension ‗D‘. The Wheeler–DeWitt equation is constructed and general solution is obtained. It is found
that for D = 6 (i.e. in10 dimension), the Wheeler–DeWitt equation is symmetric under the exchange RIR.
Which explains the most popular M-theory/string theory, Viewing particles and space-time as dual aspects of
the same thing [ See IOSR Journal of Mathematics ISSN: 2278-5728 Volume 2, Issue 4(Sep-Oct2012), PP 41
www.iosrjournals.org ‖The Complex Model of The Universe‖].
Hence the quanta and related space-time appeared to the physical universe where it might be possible
for science to insert consciousness is an additional fundamental property, (explained in the reviews Vannini and
Di Corpo, 2008 Hu and Wu, 2010,and Tarlaci, 2010,Meijer and Korf, 2013, Pereira, 2003 Atmanspacher, 2011).
Again, Georgiev, 2003 discusses epiphenomenalism, the theory that consciousness is a by-product of brain
processing having only an illusion of causal influence. He points out the evolutionary argument against this
view, to the effect that evolution would not select for something that conveyed no selective advantage. He sees
the idea that we have no freedom or moral responsibility as counterintuitive. Such a counterintuitive result is
seen as the inevitable consequence of explanations based on deterministic classical physics. Quantum mechanics
does, however, provide a non-deterministic alternative, in which consciousness underlies the neural processes of
making choices and thus effecting future possibilities. Max Tegmark asserted what was already an established
position to the effect that quantum coherence in the brain would be too short lived to have a functional role in
neural processing (Tegmark, 2000). Although an orthodoxy, to the effect that quantum coherence cannot occur
in organic matter.
Tegmark‘s paper was aimed at refuting Hameroff‘s Orch OR theory, (Hameroff and Penrose, 2011)
which required quantum coherence to be sustained for 25ms. Thus Tegmark did not show that coherence over
shorter timescales could not support consciousness, because he was directing his argument at the longer
timescales of Hameroff‘s theory. Again Tests shows that there is a minimum timescale of about 30 ms needed
for a subject to distinguish two sensory inputs as being separate. This means that consciousness cannot be
slower than 30ms. However, patients with time agonise, who have subjective experience of the passage of time,
confirm that it is physically possible to have consecutive conscious steps that are experienced as simultaneous.
From this it is argued that the real units of consciousness could be at the picoseconds level, although such units
cannot be discerned by the conscious subject. So, the upper possible bound of the timescale of consciousness
need not be its actual scale. As an analogy, Georgiev takes computer screen is on a millisecond timescale with
the screen refreshing perhaps every 10ms. But this is not indicative of the performance of the processor, which
may 18 operate on a picoseconds timescale. The refresh rate of the monitor can tell us that the processor does
not operate on a slower than 10 ms timescale. In the brain, the millisecond timescale applies to the brain‘s
communications with sensory organs and muscles, but this may not say much about its internal processing.

Quantum Neurobiology

We have from the discussion of Meijer and Korf, 2013, the idea that the physical quantum concept do
physically apply to the mind: the mental domain is considered as an aspect of wave information and a special
position takes the feature of ―superposition‖: quantum particles can be present in the multiple spatial locations
or states and be described by one or more pure state wave functions simultaneously of which a single state can
finally be selected. Although Penrose, (1989) suggested that the underlying space /time geometry in fact
bifurcates during the superposition process and wave collapse occurs in a non-computable manner. It was

suggested the conditions found in the microtubule could allow coherent quantum particles to form a unity that
can be described by a single wave function. These concepts are considered ‗the hard quantum theories‘, as
opposed to the ―soft‖ or formal theories. If someone takes the quantum model of the human mind serious and
even if someone is convinced by the admittedly weak empirical evidence for retro-causality during unconscious
processing, still there are some quite good theoretical arguments that speak against the existence of retro-causal
effects. One is related to the time travel paradox that is involved in retro-causal information transmission and
another one is related to the impossibility of supra-luminal signal transfer postulated by special relativity. The
eminent quantum scientist who suggested that the mental and the material domain are governed by common
ordering principles, and should be understood as ―complementary aspects of the same reality‖(see
Atmansapacher and Primas 1977; Primas 2003). The ―hard‖ mental QM theories apply either to specific brain
structures/molecules (this section) or to quantum fields and dimensions or both. Vannini and Di Corpo
distinguish models based on consciousness creating reality, models based on probability aspects of QM and
models based on already established QM order principles. Hu and Wu differentiate in models based on QM
elements of entanglement and coherence and models on the relation of QM with consciousness that can include
materialistic modes (consciousness emerges from material brain), dualistic mind/matter models and
panpsychistic modes. More detailed reviews can be found in Pereira, 2003 and Tuszynsky and Woolf, 2010, the
latter as an introductory chapter of the instructive book: ―Emerging Physics of Consciousness‖, while an
excellent and critical overview of the field is provided by Atmanspacher, 2011. It should also be kept in
mind that classical physics can be fully derived from quantum physics. I think which actually
started from infinite space-time called Big-Rip singularity [see IOSR Journal of Mathematics

energy density & pressure exists. The present situatio n of the universe emerging from last symmetry
breakings of the energy groups SU(11) and then SU(5) through a long continuous process from the
discrete structures of the whole universe.We found so many interpretations, as Copenhagen, Many
worlds, Implicate order, Interact ional theory, Micro-macro-scale definition, Environmental de-coherence,
Relational quantum mechanics etc. Yet a number of common elements such as the true particle/wave aspect,
instead of only a probability function, (Pusey et al., 2012), superposition, entanglement/non-locality and
coherence/de-coherence phenomena are experimentally established and remain very usable in practice. It is
often stated that quantum wave information coherence cannot be maintained long enough in the brain due to
interaction with the macro-environment of the brain components. Yet, on this point major differences in decoherence-time calculations exist, as based on various models and their intrinsic assumptions (see Hagan et al.,
2002 and Tegmark, 2000, Lloyd, 2011). A central point here is that sub-compartments could be present at the
molecular or sub-molecular level, that by their special arrangements of quantum noise protected or coherence
stabilized. Examples are internal parts of channel proteins (Bernroider, 2004), and stabilization by clustered
(gel/sol) arrangements of cytoplasmic water clusters (see Hameroff and Penrose, 1996, Penrose and Hameroff,
2011). Through coherence and macroscopic entanglement, life time of wave information can be much longer
than in the classical phase, as a consequence of coherence/de-coherence dynamic equilibrium, allowing nonlocal remote interaction in large number soft entangled neurons. Such gel/sol oscillations could even be a
primary to excitation/depolarization triggered by normal sensory stimuli and are supposed to interact with zeropoint vacuum dipole vibrations (the bi-vacuum matrix model of Kaivairanen, 2006).
It was explained that the empty/vacuum space, is not absolutely empty/vacuum, it was filled with some
unexplained new energy quanta of quark-like & lepton-like particles with strong new energy sources of
Gaussian group SU(6), SU(12), ….etc. which controlled the creation and behaviour of quark & lepton with
charge particles and hence electro-magnetic force [see ‗The Complex Quantum and Classical Pseudo Tachyonic
Universe‘]. It should be realized that de-coherence, does not, per definition imply destruction of information
since, firstly, it is not compatible with the quantum principles of non-cloning and non-deletion, secondly a cyclic
process of de-coherence and re-coherence processes cannot be excluded (see Hartmann, et al 2006; Li and
Paraoano (2009);Atmanspacher, 2011) while thirdly, even if such de-coherence does occur, it may result in
mixture of possibilities that may be accommodated by the collection of perceivable worlds in the brain (Stapp,
2012). It has been proposed by Vattay and Kauffman, 2012, that a de-coherent state can be converted back to a
coherent state by the input of adequate phase and amplitude information. The resulting coherent states can last
long enough in warm biological systems in order to, for example, enable coherent search processes for antennamediated transport of photon energy in photosynthesis. As there also exists photon-like particles of SU(6), so in
the micro domains, on the edge of chaos, could also be instrumental in the human brain as sites where a
dynamic interplay of de-coherence and re-coherence takes place. Evidence was more recently presented that
quantum physics can be applied to macromolecules (Zeilinger, 2000), and to the surprise of many, even can
occur in warm and wet biological systems (photosynthesis: Engel et al., 2010) and brains of birds in relation to
magnetic sensing and navigation (for references see Arndt et al., 2009, Lloyd, 2011). Lloyd concluded:

―Quantum coherence plays a strong role in photosynthetic energy transport, and may also play a role in the
avian compass and sense of smell. In retrospect, it should come as no surprise that quantum coherence enters
into biology. Biological processes are based on chemistry, and chemistry is based on quantum mechanics. If an
organism can attain an advantage in reproduction, however slight, by putting quantum coherence to use, then
over time natural selection has a chance to engineer the necessary biochemical mechanisms to exploit that
coherence. Different types of quantum processes that operate at the same time scale can interact strongly either
to assist or to impede one another. In photosynthetic energy transfer, the convergence of quantum time scales
gives rise to more efficient and robust transport. Evolved biological systems exhibit the quantum Goldilocks
effect: natural selection pushes together time scales to allow quantum processes to help each other out.
According to Tuszinsky and Woolf, 2010, Meijer, 2014, a spectrum of atoms/molecules has been suggested to
operate in a quantum manner: 𝑪𝒂𝟐+ ions and 𝑲+ ions, 𝑯𝟐 O, enzymes, membrane receptor and channel proteins,
membrane lipids, neurotransmitter molecules, in addition to macromolecular structures such as DNA/RNA, gap
junctions, pre-synaptic vesicles, microtubules and micro-filaments.
Since our integral universe can be described by the current laws of QM and relativity, it should be

We get the latest situations of quantum mechanics and hence, it was warranted to place the human brain
outside the nature. Even some cosmic architecture mirrored in our complex brain (Kak, 2009; Amoroso, 2003).
The discussion around higher brain functions is frequently obscured by modalities of promissory materialism:
―at present we do not understand how consciousness arises in our brain‖ but, we try to realize gradually that the
extra-dimensions as explained in my articles are associated with consciousness and now, it is required to
identify the characters and behaviours of the bosons of SU(6), ….etc. and the quanta of the first phase,
producing with the symmetry breaking of the Super Unified Group SU(11), etc., then we can identify the
characteristics of the consciousness. It may be considered that any type of expressions [as like emotions,
sentiments, angry,…, etc. for humans] of humans, animals, plants etc. is due to some kind of electromagnetic
interactions. It is not our purpose to assess the various QM theories in detail rather we intend to discuss some of
their major implications regarding the concept of a ―quantum brain‖. Several QM theories are based on specific
properties of proteins, as for instance micro-tubular proteins, (Penrose, 1989; Hameroff, 2007), proteins
involved in facilitating synaptic transmission (e.g. Beck and Eccles 1992; Beck 2001), including 𝑪𝒂+𝟐 -channels,
see Stapp, 2009), as well as specific channel proteins, instrumental in the initiation and propagation of action
potentials (K+ -channels), Bernroider and Roy, 2004), QM theories also extends the mind to different spaces
and time dimensions and some consider the individual mind (partly) as an expression of a universal mind
through holonomic communication with quantum fields. The human brain is conceived as an interfacing organ
that not only produces mind and consciousness but also receives information necessary for full deployment of
these mental phenomena. The particular local collapse of the wave function, in this manner, produces new
information. As originally proposed by Eccles, this is realized by membrane protein induced fluxes of 𝑪𝒂𝟐+ or
𝑲+ ions, that than increase the probability of fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles in the synapses, leading
to the firing of the particular neuron or even groups of neurons. The central hypothesis here is that synaptic
transmission represents a typical (quantum) probability state in which the total number of vesicles available for
exocytosis is critical for an all or none response of neuronal firing (Beck and Eccles, 1992; Beck, 2001).
Coherent neuronal perturbations and especially their entangled state are supposed to provide non-local
―binding‖ of sensory and cognitive brain centres, and may also enable perception of qualia and the unitary sense
of ―conscious self‖ (Hameroff, 2007). As the "mesoscopic" scale of brain activity where the "binding" process is
expected to occur is in the vicinity of the quantum domain, the binding principle is likely to be a quantum nonlocal effect, probably the only known physical mechanism able of performing such a task. One possibility is the
formation of a quantum photonic field (Flanagan, 2006); another possibility is the formation of coherent states
on the level of trans-membrane ion fluxes such as that of 𝐂𝐚𝟐+ ions as suggested by Pereira, 2003, 2007. The
model of Davia, 2010 (see the chapter in the book edited by Tuszinski and Woolf, 2010), proposing that
consciousness is related to travelling waves in the brain as a uniting life principle on multiple scales, which is
based on energy dissipation, enzyme catalysis, protein folding that maintains energy balance in an excitable
system such as the brain, conditions that are also compatible with the iso-energetic brain model treated in Meijer
and Korf, 2013. Penrose, 1989; Hameroff, 2007 have discussed that microtubule, in principle, can maintain
quantum states (i.e. superposition) lasting at least 𝟏𝟎−𝟔 seconds, long enough to be instrumental in the transfer of
quantum wave information. Such lasting quantum states are possible because of the shielding of hydrophobic
pockets in the particular proteins, as well as the formation of coherent clusters of these molecules that thereby
share a common quantum wave function (so called Bose-Einstein Condensates). There is indirect evidence that
microtubules may be relevant for neuro-cognition: increased synthesis in relation to postnatal development with
regard to synaptogenesis and visual learning and as counterpart aging deficits in memory as well as interactions

with general anaesthetics (Penrose and Hameroff, 2011, 2012; Tuszynski and Woolf, 2010; Kalvairainen, 2005).
Yet such correlative studies should not only be further substantiated with experiments that show quantum states
in isolated tubules, as reported by (Bandyopadhyay, 2011), but rather and most importantly, directly
demonstrate tubular involvement in higher brain functions. .More recently in 2013 Bandyopadhyay‘s group
demonstrated that in microtubules the energy level of up to 40,000 individual tubulin proteins and the energy
level of the microtubule are the same. The water core and the individual tubulin proteins are suggested to control
the properties of the microtubule by means of delocalised electromagnetic oscillations. The properties of the
microtubule might be taken to suggest that the system can support a macroscopic quantum state.
In conclusion: tubular and synaptic channel proteins exhibit conformational transitions within
𝟏𝟎−𝟗 seconds that may last for 𝟏𝟎−𝟔 seconds or even longer, (Beck and Eccles 1992; Beck 2001; Bernroider and
Roy, 2004, Kaivairainen, 2005). These perturbations may last long enough to be finally detected as miniature
neuronal potentials (Hamill et al., 1981, Hagan et al., 2002). The particular mechanisms also imply a
manifestation of non-local quantum effects due to distant coherence, which was actually produced by the new
energy or quanta as expressed in my articles. Again phenomenon that was even recorded in laser stimulated
neuronal cell cultures in which classical physical explanations were excluded (Pizzi et al., 2004).

VI.

How Consciousness Arises From Quantum-Gravity

The coherence of such quantum states among brain proteins has been suggested to lead to material
changes in brain physiology through orchestrated collapse of quantum coherent clusters of tubulin proteins,
triggered by quantum gravity expressed at the spin (Planck scale) level. On the basis of a recent theory on the
nature of gravity (Verlinde, 2011), postulating that gravity is not a force but rather an entropic compensation for
the movement of mass/information, it was speculated that consciousness may arise from a gravity - mediated
reaction on the entropic displacement of information as it occurs in high density in the human brain (Meijer,
2012). Anyhow, there should be a mechanism to integrate signal processing within a single neuron with other,
even distant, neurons and consequently non-local effects due to quantum entanglement formed by the
condensation of the quanta-like from another phase like the phase transition system where the bosons of the
group SU(6) controlling the whole systems. Again these quantum processes may explain phenomena such as
qualia, meaning, sensation of unity, intentionality as well as conflict solving, reliability in the sense of
correspondence with the outer world and the sense of self. The latter is related to the feeling of causal power that
could result from a quantum/classical interface in which classical synaptic processes create a quantum coherent
state that enables quantum computation that exert a back-influence on the original synaptic process (Pereira,
2003, 2007).
The existence of non-locality in brain function, being a basic property of the universe strongly argues
for an underlying deep reality out of space/time as originally proposed by Bohm (1990) in the form of an
implicate order. But we may assume that it is associated with the extra-dimensional space-times other than 4dimensional space-times. Bohm claimed that these mechanisms also play a role in different forms of
transpersonal and extrasensory perception by wave resonance with universal quantum field (Kak, 2009, Jahn
and Dunne, 2007, Kafatos and Draganescu, 2000, Kafatos, 2009). The wave information could be transmitted
from and into the brain by wave resonance and may locally collapse to matter entities through conscious
observation, including sufficient individual attention and intention (Stapp, 2009).
Stapp (2012) argued recently that this does not represent an interference effect between superposed
states, as assumed by Hameroff and Penrose (1996), but that through environmental de-coherence, superpositions will be converted to multiple mixtures of information. Since our brain contains a large collection of
perceivable worlds, it is able by super causal free choice and subsequent common random choice to make a fit
with one or more of the above mentioned mixed information modalities. The particular waves than spread out
and rapid sequence repetitions (the so called Zeno effect) may sufficiently maintain coherence in parts of the
brain. Of note, Stapp does not see free will as based on quantum probability aspects. He states: ―In the original
Copenhagen formulation this extra process is initiated by what is called ―A free choice on the part of the
experimenter.‖ The phrase ―free choice‖ emphasizes the fact that, while a definite particular choice is needed,
this choice is not determined by any known law or rule: The purely physical aspects of the theory have,
therefore a significant causal gap, which opens the door to a possible causal input from the mentally side of
reality‖.The existence of a quantum superposition is a linear function of the extent to which information is
available about the alternative states that constitute the superposition (Wang, Zou and Mandel, 1991). The more
distorted the information about the single states is, and therefore the less classical (0/1) it is, the more ideal a
superposition will be.
Quantum information may exert physical effects via a bottom-up flow of information starting at spin
networks (Penrose, 1994; Hu and Wu, 2010), that can be passed on as wave forms of elementary
particles/atoms, to be ultimately expressed at the level of neuronal molecules. Meijer and Korf, 2013, consider
the latter flow of information more feasible than being directly transferred through vibratory interference at the

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
molecular level. According to this integral quantum model, perturbations at the various spatiotemporal domains
allow both time-symmetric forward and backward causation and therefore top-down influence of quantum
fields. The basic question is: how are quantum waves or quantum fields finally perceived by the human brain
and how they influence or even induce phenomena as (self) consciousness? Organisms do indeed visually
perceive photons that exhibit wave/particle duality; humans even senseless than ten photons, whereas insects
may even detect a single photon (Baylor et al., 1979; Menini et al., 1995). Sensitive detection is possible with
dedicated cellular structures as for instance in the mammalian retina that amplify the energy of a single photon
by a cascade of processes, based on changes of protein conformations and cellular potential energy, leading to
the electrochemical stimulation of neurons projecting to the brain. Recently, photosensitive proteins have been
coupled to ion-channel proteins with biotechnical techniques, so that the neural activity can be modified or
inhibited in vivo by light introduced via optic micro-fibres (Lima and Miesenböck, 2005; Boyden et al., 2005;
Tsai et al., 2009). These experimental approaches demonstrate that quantum effects may directly affect neural
function, but it remains to be shown more definitely, that this also does occur directly inside the human brain as
it was demonstrated in the brain of birds (see the reviews of Arndt et al., 2009, Lloyd, 2011). It was proposed by
Martin (Martin et al, 2013) that archetypes can be stored as quantum systems and that consciousness may be
controlled by quantum entanglement from outside of the 4-dimensional space-time. That means higherdimensional space-times.
Our physical universe actually starts the journey from the stages of 10-dimensional space-time. So
appears our present 4-dimensional physical universe. All the molecules/atoms biological elements and all
physical laws including theoretical & experimental are explained on the basis of standard model of physics
within 4-dimensional space-time. We assumed that, the actual universe were multi-dimensional. All the quanta
with photon-like of SU(6), SU(12),..., constitutes a package of new energy particles or conscious particles which
controlled the whole universe with an appropriate consciousness/intelligences as well as created self
consciousness within our complete live body. Interestingly, recently a 5-dimensional space-time brane model
was proposed in order to adequately position of consciousness and universal consciousness in the cosmos
(Carter, 2014a, 2014b), an item that was discussed earlier by Smythies, 2003 suggesting that consciousness may
be in a brane rather than in the brain. Atmanspacher (2003) explained that mind/matter correlations may require
new science, in the sense that the use of emergence and reductionistic schemes may not be adequate and should
be replaced by possible symmetry breaking within a domain in which matter and mind are un-separated. He
cites d‘Espanat postulating an independent the ‗Ultimate Reality‘ that is neither mental nor material.
According to the Gaussian transformation theory our created universe actually started from the
symmetry breaking of the Gaussian group SU(11) [  SU(6)  SU(5)  U(1)], from which we get two
fundamentally energy groups, SU(6) and SU(5), where SU(6) leads to a phase transition action and
then fundamental matter energy group SU(5) breaks into subgroups SU(3)  SU(2) L  U(1), in
which the scalar field Φ changes. The original vacuum, i .e. with false vacuum (  = 0 ) is no longer the
true vacuum ( = ). The inflationary stage arises, however, if the true vacuum is not immediately attained [see
the details explanation in my article ‗The complex model of the universe‘]. SU(6) creates as intelligence/mind of
our universe as well as self consciousness with respect to the energy group SU(5), and hence SU(6) controlled
the whole universe as quantum mind in the domain of SU(11). Therefore, in the theory of SU(11), it is possible
to change any of 30(thirty) photonic bosons of intelligence/ quantum mind of SU(6) into any of 30(thirty)
material energy photonic bosons of SU(5) or vice-versa by the exchange of the J-bosons of SU(11) within the
same symmetry or domain. That is why it becomes possible to create or destroy material substances and hence
matter & mind are not separated from each other within the same domain of SU(11). Which also explained by
Atmanspacher (2003) that mind & matter are correlated.
So, the famous postulates of d‘Espanat: there exists an independent ―Ultimate Reality‖, i.e. neither
mental nor material. Although, which explained details in my article ‗The Origin of Consciousness in the
universe- IOSR‖, that our universe appears by the several symmetry breaking of the energy group from Big-Rip
singularity. Now, consciousness should be a property of all living structures in which each biological process is
forced to choose between information coming from the past and information coming from the future (King,
2003). We consider such models (including that of Vannini and Di Corpo, 2008) attribute consciousness to
principles of generalised relativity theory of higher dimensions (4+D) with complex space-time (R + iRI) and
quantum physics with new energy sources of the energy group SU(6). Processing an amplification of
quanta/wave information in the brain may underlie the presumed higher brain or mental functions. If one
assumes that such detection mechanisms does indeed operate in the brain, then the next question is whether the
information to be processed is exclusively associated with quantum waves or quantum states or, alternatively,
with the specific proteins that carry them. Apart from discussing the inherent mechanisms such as forward and
backward causation, superposition and entanglement in the mental space, we shortly treat the idea that
individual mind may, at least partly, be an expression of universal consciousness as opposed to the concept the
mind is merely an attribute of matter. It was shown in my articles that the Wheeler-DeWitt equations valid for

tachyonic universe as well as pseudo-tachyonic universe, when space-time is R + iRI. That means the
Hamiltonian is well defined in the pseudo-tacyonic field in respect to the pseudo-space RI. Hence, we consider
that, if one can always choose such a quantum state, which does not disappear at any value of RI which
guarantees the positivistic of the quantum average of the operator.

Explanation of Undivided Wholeness of The Universe

In Bohm‘s scheme there is an unbroken wholeness at the fundamental level of the universe, in which
consciousness is not separated from matter. Bohm says that in the implicate order intermingled elements are
present together, and processes are the outcome of what is enfolded in the implicate order. In this structure, there
is a flow between experiences and logical thought that is considered by Bohm to hold out the possibility of a
bridge between matter and consciousness. Bohm also advances the idea of overall necessity driving short-term
brain processes. Thus it is proposed that an ensemble of elements enfolded in the brain will constitute the next
development of thought, and that these elements are bound by an overall necessity that brings them together and
also determines the next moment in consciousness. Basil Hiley was the long-term associate of David Bohm,
(Bohm and Hiley, 1987, 1993). They argue that the Bohmian notion of active information introduced in relation
to quantum phenomena can also be applied to classical signalling. This is suggested to have relevance to
concept of meaning as opposed to mere information. Hiley queries whether the word ‗information‘ that is
widely used in science including neuroscience always carries the same meaning. Bohm and Hiley were
interested in so-called active information that drives physical processes and leaves no choice as to whether they
are implemented or not. This is distinct from a mere list of data or instructions or a way of viewing entropy.
Active information has been used in a number of papers relative to the mind/matter relationship (Hiley, 2001
and Hiley & Pylkkänen, 2005). The colloquial understanding of information is that it is data from which
meaning can be extracted by an intelligent entity. Hiley regards it as a fundamental question as to whether
information has objective significance devoid of the subjective involvement. Verbal communication is seen as a
particular problem, where meaning is translated into sound waves and then back into meaning. Hiley relates this
meaning to the agency of the speaker and the agency of the listener. He relates this inseparable link to Bohr‘s
notion of the indivisibility of the quantum action, which cannot distinguish between the system under
observation and the means of observation.
Thus, in our cosmological model we can say that the requirements of the well-definiteness of the
pseudo-tachyonic part of the Hamiltonian operator in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, does not reveal the effect of
the quantum avoidance of the cosmological singularity. Hence, there some kind of classical-quantum
correspondence, as it was shown in the classical tachyon and pseudo-tachyon model exists an infinite one
parameter set of the cosmological evolution. Which implied an undivided wholeness of the universe and an
implicate order, from which arose the explicate order of the universe as we actually experience it. The explicate
order is seen as a particular case of the implicate order. The concept of implicate order of David Bohm 1980,
1990, in which particles and their more complex forms in our classical world are steered by, so called, pilot
waves that operate from a 4-dimensional hidden domain, in a mode of active information. The implicate order
applies both to matter and consciousness, and it can therefore explain the relationship between these two
apparently different things. Mind and matter are here seen as related projections into our explicate order from
the underlying reality of the implicate order. Bohm claims that when we look at the extension of matter and
separation of its parts in space, we can see nothing in these concepts that helps us with understanding
consciousness.
We believe that the quantum potential could be extracted from the previous energy stages (first stage)
with SU(6),….etc. then to the present of the second stage with SU(5) by the process of energy transfer through
the Wheeler-DeWitt wave functions and that quantum potential could act as an information potential. In
transmitting a signal there is a trade off between the duration of the pulse and the frequency. There is an
ambiguity in the signal that is similar to the uncertainty in quantum mechanics. Hiley refers it, to the two-slit
experiment, where the potential is claimed to cover the whole experimental arrangement. The quantum
information changes in relation to any change in the experimental arrangement, and this is related to information
entering the brain and changing the arrangement of its parts.
Again within the brain, Bohm thought that meaning was in the process itself. Bohm proposed that there
were two sides or two poles to the brain, the manifest or relatively stable material side and other is the subtle
mind-like side. The manifest side is classical physics, while the subtle side is the quantum level that produces
the classical level. Thus the mind cannot be separated from matter. The ambiguity or uncertainty of the quantum
comes through in the ambiguity attached to meaning. The quantum is seen as a pool of information shared by
entangled particles. I think that the information potential may be gained by the quanta-like energies with
exchanging the boson particles from SU(6) to SU(5) or vice-versa. That means when the potential or pool
vanishes (according to our perception), the classical world emerges. Hiley also agrees that this system could
operate in terms of quantum fields. But the description seems to be the lack of detail as to how the quantum

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
mechanism would operate in the brain. The emergence of meaning could be developed from the theory of new
energy sources SU(6), SU(12),… etc., the new concepts about the mechanisms of consciousness. It is clear from
the Bohm‘s view, that all the separate objects, entities, structures, and events in the visible or explicate world
around us are relatively autonomous, stable, and temporary ‘sub-totalities‘ derived from a deeper, implicate
order of unbroken wholeness. Bohm gives the analogy of a flowing stream: On this stream, one may see an
ever-changing pattern of vortices, ripples, waves, splashes, etc., which evidently have no independent existence
as such. Rather, they are abstracted from the flowing movement, arising and vanishing in the total process of the
flow. Such transitory subsistence as may be possessed by these abstracted forms implies only a relative
independence or autonomy of behaviour, rather than absolutely independent existence as ultimate substances.
Bohm tried to adopt an interpretation of the wave as a manifestation of a deeper level, perhaps associated with
consciousness. Also from the Pilot-wave theory of Antony Valentini follows quantum mathematics, but at the
same time allows for new possibilities beyond conventional quantum mechanics. It's a theory that says there is
indeed an objective reality behind the things we observe, that quantum uncertainty is not fundamental, and that
somewhere, somehow, time is universal not relative which implies to hidden variables that are objective.
American physicist John Archibald Wheeler (1990, 2002) who suspected that reality exists not because
of physical particles, but rather because of the act of observing the universe. "Information may not be just what
we learn about the world. It may be what makes the world". In other words: when humans ask questions about
nature, there is an active transfer of information in the domain of quantum waves where, in principle, backward
causation from the future is possible. The second arrow (from future to past) remain hidden (unnoticed) for us,
because life is trapped in the momentum of time. Entanglement means that particles separated at any distance,
under certain conditions, can have mutually determined properties (are correlated). Hence universe multiple
paths or life lines are laid out of which the individual chooses a single one, i.e. there exists a moment of grand
super unified theory SU(11)[  SU(5)  SU(6)  U(1)] coming after an infinite numbers of such symmetry
breakings. Such non-locality becomes manifested by observation (or collapsed of the wave functions), as has
been shown by electron spin orientation or polarized light. This might also be viewed as backward causation.
According to Wheeler‘s (1990) and Feynman‘s electrodynamics, emitters coincide with retarded fields, which
propagate into the future, while absorbers coincide with advanced fields, which propagate backward in time.
This time-symmetric model leads to predictions identical with those of conventional electrodynamics. For this
reason it is impossible to distinguish between time symmetric results and conventional results. Explanation of
John Cramer (1988), Transactional Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics the transaction between retarded
waves, coming from the past, and advanced waves, coming from the future, gives birth to a quantum entity with
dual properties of the wave/particle. Thus the wave property is a consequence of the interference between
retarded and advanced waves, and the particle property is a consequence of the point in space where the
transaction takes place‖.
The principle of backward causation has been experimentally demonstrated recently. Aharonov‘s team
and various collaborating groups (see Aharonov, 2010), studied whether the future may influence the past by
sophisticated quantum physics technology. Aharonov concluded that a particle‘s past does not contain enough
information to fully predict its fate, but he wondered, if the information is not in its past, where could it be?
Clearly, something else must also regulate the particle‘s behaviour. Thus we may explain that the future may be
influenced by the past by introducing some new energy sources as SU(6), SU(12),...etc. called pseudo energy
groups, which controls the future particles carrying with information‘s. We assume that our existing 4dimensional universe is actually unfolded from 10-dimensional space-time/with the symmetry breaking of
SU(11) of the super-unified group, although our matter universe or so called real/physical universe, unfolded
from the symmetry breaking of the unified group SU(5). The first stages always remained in the form of waves
and the boson particles of SU(6) are so strong, that the quanta-like is transferred through the wave functions
collapses or transferred into quanta particles of the unified Gaussian energy group SU(5), that means the exotic
matter fluid is transferred into ordinary matter fluids where the energy is in the form maintaining the waveparticle duality principle, the entanglement. So, between two particles within the standard model of physics
there must be existence a pseudo-energy force, carrying with information energies through the waves. We view
quantum particle as entangled, i.e. maintaining the wave particle duality principle. Hence it is possible, that the
same quantum particles occurred in different places, due to the existences of latent-particles formed by SU(6)
between two places that means our universe always is filled with some new energies. According to Stapp, 2009,
2012, the brain is viewed as a self-programming computer with self-sustaining neural patterns as the codes. It is
necessary to integrate the code from sensory input, with the code from previous experience. This creates a
number of probabilities, from which consciousness has to select. The conscious act is the selection of a piece of
top-level code, which then exercises control over the flow of neural excitation. The unity of conscious thought
comes from a unifying force in the conscious act itself. It selects a single code from amongst a multitude on
offer in the brain. This is suggested to close the traditional explanatory gap between thought and classical
physics, because here the conscious thought is the selection of the code that allows the physical act, which

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
proves the signature of the existences of the energy groups SU(6), SU(12), SU(24),…etc and a relations between
all energy groups by commanding from top-level to bottom-level. According to Stapp, top- level codes instruct
lower-level codes to produce new top level codes and to initiate their storage in memory. There are close
connections between the top-level code and the memory structure. The lower level codes have to be functioning
correctly i.e. not damaged, and to be focused on the incoming stimuli in order for it to be put into higher level
code and to be registered in memory. It is necessary to find the neurons providing the top level coding, then the
mechanism for storing memory traces of this, and finally the mechanism by which these memories are involved
in the production of new top-level codes. Stapp attaches great importance to the idea of the formation of a
record. This is seen as analogous to the Geiger counter that registers a record of a quantum event. Every
conscious experience is seen as recordable, because it is evidence of some form of brain process.
Again the identity theory of mind claims that each mental state is identical to some process in the brain.
However, classical physics says that the entire causal structure of a physical system is determined by the
microscopic level of the physical structure, so that larger scale effects such as consciousness cannot have any
influence. A potential problem with the whole Copenhagen influenced interpretation of quantum theory is its
possible dualism. Mathematics can be seen as a mental process instantiated in protein, which, in principle,
cannot directly influence the external world. Somehow the mathematical description of the quantum waves is
sitting out there in space, and then as a result of a measurement becomes a physical particle. In Copenhagen, a
mental concept external to the body seems to become physical with no explanation as to how the two could
interact. The Copenhagen system has the additional problem of what was happening before human minds
emerged to perform measurements, for which Stapp‘s explanation appears rather sketchy. Consequently, a more
detailed model is required to picture the inherent interaction between a more general of consciousness as a
measuring device in evolution. Hence we required a new concept for the explanations of the present situations
of our universe beyond the standard model of physics.

Difference Between Computer Robot And Human Brain

What is the actual difference between computer robot and brain of human? According to Feferman
1996 who agrees with Penrose that understanding is essential to mathematical thought that mechanics cannot
share with us. That means or by considering that human thought, and in particular mathematical thought, is not
achieved by the mechanical application of algorithms, but rather by trial-and-error, insight and inspiration, in a
process that machines will never share with humans. The model of mathematical thought in terms of formal
systems is considered to be closer to the nature of human thought, and particularly mathematical thought, than to
the functioning of Turing machines. The Turing machine model would assume that given a problem, human
reason would plug away, applying the same algorithm indefinitely, in the hope of finding an answer. Feferman
says that it is ridiculous to think that mathematics is performed in this way. Trial-and-error reasoning, insight
and inspiration, based on prior experience, but not on general rules, are seen as the basis of mathematical
success. Penrose also proposes that OR based quantum computation occurs in the brain. Penrose went on to ask,
what it was in the human brain that was not based on algorithms. The physical law is described by mathematics,
but it is not easy to come up with a process that is not governed by algorithms. The only plausible candidate that
Penrose could find was the collapse of the quantum wave function, where the choice of the position of a particle
is random, and therefore not the product of an algorithm. The quantum theory repeatedly comes back to
the theme that Penrose regards the quantum world and the un -collapsed wave function as having
objective existence. The important discussions implied the existences of the new energy sources SU(6),
SU(12), SU(23),……….∞. In Penrose‘s view, the objective reality of the quantum world allows it to
play a role in consciousness. If we consider the superposition of the quantum wave function by using
Wheeler-DeWitt wave equation of the whole universe instead of using Schrödinger type wave equation of our 4dimensional universe, the energy behaves like off-on mode by the quanta particles with the strong latent force
SU(6) which collapses into quanta particles by exchanging the bosons of SU(6) to SU(5) and then breaking into
SU(3), SU(2), & U(1) randomly through a continuous process from discrete structures of the universe otherwise
having objective existences of un-collapsed wave functions. In this process, it may be possible to create a
human-like brain within robotic computer and then robotic computer brain behaves like as human brain when it
was given some initial information/experiences. Naturally it may be possible when created a strong field force
by SU(6) with an electromagnetic interaction between the energy groups SU(6) & U(1) [U(1) is an
electrodynamics group] in the frame-work of SU(6)  U(1) and together with the weak electromagnetic
interaction of energy group SU(2) with U(1) in the frame-work of SU(2)  U(1). Continuing this process like
trial and error reasoning, insight, and inspiration are based on prior experiences and till to the reasonable
experiences.
I, agree with Eugene Wigner‘s (see Wigner, 1992) suggestion that it is consciousness that collapses the
wave function, as stated by Penrose and that the collapse of a special (objective) type of wave function produces
consciousness. Penrose sees consciousness as not only related to the quantum level but also to space-time. He

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
thinks in terms of time-asymmetrical quantum gravity [I think that quantum gravity comes from the energy
group SU(6)], because the universe is time-asymmetric from low to high entropy. He argues that the
conventional process of collapse of the wave function is time-asymmetric. He describes an experiment where
light is emitted from a source and strikes a half-silvered mirror with a resulting 50% probability that the light
reaches a detector and 50% that it hits a darkened wall. This experiment cannot be time-reversed, because if the
original emitter now detects an incoming photon, there is not a 50% probability that it was emitted by the wall,
but instead 100% that it was emitted by the other detecting/emitting device. Hameroff and Penrose, 2011, 2013
classify all the mainstream approaches to consciousness as ‗classical functionalism‘. Functionalism takes no
account of what the brain is made of or of anything finer grained than the level of neuron-to-neuron connections.
It believes that these connections could be copied in another material such as silicon, and that the resulting
construct would be conscious. Hameroff thinks that consciousness arises in the dendrites of neurons that are
connected by gap junctions to form ‗hyper-neurons‘, and that these are related to the gamma synchrony. Axonal
spikes and synapses are seen as making inputs to and receiving outputs from the micro tubular process as part of
an interactive system. Hameroff touches on the famous Libet, 2006 experiments that demonstrated a 500ms time
lag between a stimulus and the perception of it entering consciousness. He points out that changes in dendrites
can lead to increased synaptic activity. This is basic to ideas about learning, memory and neural correlates of
consciousness. The changes in dendrites involve the number and arrangement of receptors and the arrangement
of dendrite spines and dendrite-to-dendrite connections. Axon potentials or spikes have been assumed to be the
main basis of consciousness, but Hammeroff suggests that there could be other candidates. We assumed it may
be played by the new energy sources as stated previous. Electrodes implanted into the brain detect mainly the
activity of dendrites gap junctions plus inhibitory chemical synapses. Thus the detected synchrony derives from
dendrites rather than axonal spikes.
Gamma synchronies, in the 30-70 Hz range, have aroused interest as possible correlates of
consciousness. Gray and Singer, 1989, found coherent gamma oscillations in the brain that were dependent on
visual stimulation. It was suggested that this synchrony could solve the binding problem, which is the problem
of how the different inputs into the brain are bound together into a single conscious experience. It was suggested
that the synchrony related the activity of a relevant assembly of neurons. Varela, 1995 noted that synchrony
operated whenever the processing of spatially separated parts of the brain were brought together in
consciousness practically. Gamma synchrony has been demonstrated across cortical areas, hemispheres and the
sensory/motor modalities. The synchrony is involved in a range of brain activities including perception of
sound, REM, dream sleep, attention, working memory, face recognition and somatic perception. Also gamma
decreases during general anaesthesia and returns on waking from this. So, gamma synchrony is the best overall
correlate of consciousness. Hameroff points to gap junctions as an alternative to synapses for connections
between neurons. Neurons that are connected by gap junctions depolarize synchronously. Gap junctions play a
more important role in the adult brain than was previously supposed. Numerous studies show that gap junctions
mediate the gamma synchrony. A neuron may have many gap junction connections but not all of them are
necessarily open at the same time. The opening and closing of the junctions may be regulated by the
microtubules. Hameroff suggests that cells connected by gap junctions may in fact constitute a cell assembly,
with the added advantage of synchronous excitation. He discussed the role of the cytoskeleton, which is seen to
determine the structure, growth and function of neurons. The cytoskeleton of the dendrites is distinct both from
that found in cells outside the brain and from the cytoskeleton found in the axons of neurons. Hameroff
discusses the process of anesthesia which erases consciousness, but leaves many non-conscious functions intact.
Anesthetic gas molecules are soluble in a lipid-like hydrophobic environment. Such areas are present in the
brain in the lipid regions of cell membranes and in hydrophobic pockets within proteins. It is suggested that
anesthetic gas molecules interact with amino-acid groups via London forces, altering the normal action of
London forces on the conformation of protein. Hameroff discusses quantum information processing. Quantum
superposition‘s where the quantum waves represent multiple possibilities for the state of a particle, are known to
persist until quanta are either measured or naturally interact with the rest of the environment. He takes the view
that the original mainstream interpretation, Copenhagen Interpretation, puts not only consciousness but the
concept of reality itself outside the standard model of physics. A recent review and update of this 20-year-old
theory of consciousness published in Physics of Life Reviews, 2013, persists to claim that consciousness derives
from deeper level that means we may assume that it creates from the first stage of the quanta with the energy
group SU(6), plays major role to the quanta of the second stage i.e. our present dissertation and hence the finer
scale activities inside brain neurons. The recent discovery of quantum vibrations in "microtubules" inside brain
neurons corroborates this theory. Hameroff and Penrose suggest that EEG rhythms (brain waves) also derive
from deeper level of microtubule vibrations and that from a practical standpoint, treating brain microtubule
vibrations could benefit a host of mental, neurological, and cognitive conditions. Orch OR was harshly criticized
from its inception, as the brain was considered too "warm, wet, and noisy" for seemingly delicate quantum

processes. However, evidence has now shown warm quantum coherence in plant photosynthesis, bird brain
navigation, our sense of smell, & brain microtubules.
The research group led by Anirban Bandyopadhyay, 2011, at the National Institute of Material
Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan (and now at MIT), has recently discover in warm temperature, quantum vibrations
in microtubules inside brain neurons suggests that EEG rhythms also derive from deeper level microtubule
vibrations. In addition, work from the laboratory of Emerson and Eckenhoff et al, 2013, at the University of
Pennsylvania, suggests that anesthesia, which selectively erases consciousness while sparing non-conscious
brain activities, acts via microtubules in brain neurons. The origin of consciousness reflects our place in the
universe, the nature of our existence.
Again Hameroff explained that consciousness depends on biologically ‗orchestrated‘ coherent quantum
processes in collections of microtubules within brain neurons, that these quantum processes correlate with, and
regulate, neuronal synaptic and membrane activity. The continuous Schrödinger evolution of each such process
is supposed to terminate in accordance with the specific Diósi–Penrose (DP) scheme of ‗objective reduction‘
(‗OR‘) of the quantum state. This orchestrated OR activity (‗Orch OR‘) is taken to result in moments of
conscious awareness and/or choice. The DP form of OR is related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics
and space–time geometry, so Orch OR suggests that there is a connection between the brain‘s bio-molecular
processes and the basic structure of the universe. The DP version of OR involves a different interpretation of the
term ‗quantum gravity‘ from what is usual. Current ideas of quantum gravity (see, for example, Smolin, 2004),
normally refers, instead, to some sort of physical scheme that is to be formulated within the bounds of standard
quantum field theory—hence it is needed a new concept of the quantum field theory to explain the actual
occurrence about the origin of consciousness and such explanation may be found-out from the theory of my new
energy sources of SU(6), SU(12), SU(23),……….∞. It is helpful to have a conceptual picture of quantum
superposition in a super gravitational context that means in the super-unified theory of SU(11 ) [  SU(5) 
SU(6)  U(1)], where the energy group SU(6) creates gravitational field. According to modern accepted
physical theories, reality is rooted in 3-dimensional space and a 1-dimensional time, combined together into a 4dimensional space–time. But here we consider that the origin of reality is rooted in (4+D)–dimensional
Friedmann–Robertson–Walker type universe having complex scale factor R + iR I , where R is the scale factor
corresponding to the usual 4–dimensional Universe while R I is that of D–dimensional space. It is then compared
with (4+D)–dimensional Kaluza–Klein cosmology having scale factors R and a (= iR I ), the internal space-time.
It is shown that the rate of compactification of higher dimension depends on extra dimension ‗D‘. The Wheeler–
DeWitt equation is constructed and general solution & particular solution is obtained. It is found that for D = 6
(i.e. in 4 + 6 = 10 dimension), the Wheeler–DeWitt equation is symmetric under the exchange R I R. Hence,
according to the new theories our actual reality of the so called material universe is rooted in 10-dimensional
space-time instead of 4-dimensional space-time. Our conscious energies are associated with 10-dimensional to
5-dimensional space-time. The initial part of each space-time is at the upper left of each individual space–time
diagram, and so the bifurcating space–time diagram on right moving downward and rightward illustrates two
alternative mass distributions evolving in time, their space–time curvature separation increasing mechanically
(so long as OR has not taken place), the ‗physical reality‘ of this situation, as provided by the evolving wave
function, is being illustrated as an actual superposition of these two differing space-time manifolds, The OR
process is considered to occur when quantum superposition‘s between such slightly differing space-times take
place differing from one another by an integrated space-time measure.
In the situations under consideration here, where we expect a conscious brain to be at far from zero
temperature, and because technological quantum computers require zero temperature, it is very reasonable to
question quantum brain activities. Nevertheless, it is now well known that superconductivity and other largescale quantum effects can actually occur at temperatures very far from absolute zero. Indeed, biology appears to
have evolved thermal mechanisms to promote quantum coherence. Ouyang and Awschalom, 2003 showed that
quantum spin transfer through phenyl ring π orbital resonance clouds (the same as those in protein hydrophobic
regions, are enhanced at increasingly warm temperatures. Spin flip currents through microtubule pathways, may
be directly analogous). In the past 6 years, evidence has accumulated that plants routinely use quantum coherent
electron transport at ambient temperatures in photosynthesis Engel et al, 2007 and Hildner, 2013. Photons are
absorbed in one region of a photosynthetic protein complex, and their energy is conveyed by electronic
excitations through the protein to another region to be converted to chemical energy to make food. In this
transfer, electrons utilize multiple pathways simultaneously, through π electron clouds in a series of
chromophores (analogous to hydrophobic regions) spaced nanometres apart, maximizing efficiency (e.g. via socalled ‗exciton hopping‘). Chromophores in photosynthesis proteins appear to enable electron quantum
conductance precisely like aromatic rings are proposed in Orch OR to function in tubulin and microtubules.
Quantum conductance through photosynthesis protein is enhanced by mechanical vibration, and
microtubules appear to have their own set of mechanical vibrations e.g. in megahertz as suggested by Sahu et
al., 2013. Megahertz mechanical vibrations is ultrasound, and brief, low intensity (sub-thermal) ultrasound

administered through the skull to the brain modulates electrophysiology, behaviour and affect, e.g. improved
mood in patients suffering from chronic pain, perhaps by direct excitation of brain microtubules.
Bandyopadhyayʼs experiments do seem to provide clear evidence for coherent microtubule quantum states at
brain temperature. The Hameroff–Penrose form of orchestrated objective reduction (Hameroff and Penrose,
2011, 2013) is related to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and space–time geometry that means a
connection between the basic structure of the Universe and bio-molecular processes. Relating these effects to
neurons might appear an unjustified self-inflicted limitation and, in this perspective, the general conclusion
should not be avoided: consciousness is a property and a manifestation of life, life is universal in principle.
Thus, consciousness is in principle universal‖. A note of caution: Roger Penrose himself recently said: ―I do not
see why we should take quantum mechanics as sacrosanct. I think there were going to be something else which
replaces it‖. These words, if they can be considered as not being out-of-context, find their explanation in the
incompleteness of quantum theory. For the completeness, we should consider the extension of the quantum
theory with the new energy groups SU(6), SU(11), SU(12), SU(23),……….∞ other than the unified group
SU(5), appeared by the symmetry breaking from infinite. The last destination of the process of symmetry
breaking is to be unified energy group SU(5)[ SU(3)  SU(2)L  U(1)], the standard model of physics
according to our present assumption. The quanta of the super-unified group SU(11) breaks into SU(6)  SU(5) 
U(1), in which from 10-dimensional to 5-dimensional space-time plays a vital role creating as consciousness
with conscious particles of atom-like or element-like by the strong force SU(6). In respect to SU(5), where
quark with charge particles forms atoms of the elements and compound elements also bio-molecules etc. of the
material world instructed by conscious energy and then consciousness arrives within the complete living body.
There are created two types of electromagnetic interaction in the frame-work SU(6)  U(1), which are also
responsible for conscious sensory or intelligence with respect to the ordinary sensory with the frame-work
SU(2)L  U(1). Consciousness seems to be folded till to the symmetry breaking of SU(5) or otherwise the
creation of live-element i.e. till to the 4-dimensional space-time and then unfolded. Anirban Bandyopadhyay and
his colleagues from 2009, at the National Institute of Material Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan, were able to use
nanotechnology to address electronic and optical properties of individual microtubules (Sahu et al, 2013a, b).
The group has made a series of remarkable discoveries suggesting that quantum effects do occur in microtubules
at biological temperatures. First, they found that electronic conductance along microtubules, normally extremely
good insulators, becomes exceedingly high, approaching quantum conductance, at certain specific resonance
frequencies of applied alternating current (AC) stimulation. These resonances occur in gigahertz, megahertz and
kilohertz ranges, and are particularly prominent in low megahertz (e.g. 8.9 MHz). Conductance‘s induced by
specific (e.g. megahertz) AC frequencies appear to follow several types of pathways through the microtubule—
helical, linear along the microtubule axis, and ‗blanket-like‘ along/around the entire microtubule surface.
Second, using various techniques, the Bandyopadhyay group also determined AC conductance through 25-nmwide microtubules is greater than through single 4-nm-wide tubulins, indicating cooperative, possibly quantum
coherent effects throughout the microtubule, and that the electronic properties of microtubules are programmed
within each tubulin. Their results also showed that conductance increased with microtubule length, indicative of
quantum mechanisms. The resonance conductance (‗Bandyopadhyay coherence‘ –‗BC‘) through tubulins and
microtubules is consistent with the intra-tubulin aromatic ring pathways, which can support Orch OR quantum
dipoles, and in which anaesthetics bind, apparently to selectively erase consciousness. Bandyopadhyayʼs
experiments do seem to provide clear evidence for coherent microtubule quantum states at brain temperature.
So the fact for instance that anaesthetic gas exert their effects on consciousness, and that actual evidence from
genomics and proteomics point to anaesthetic action in microtubules. Frohlich saw the electric potential across
the cell membrane as the macroscopic observable of an underlying quantum order. Frohlich‘s studies claim to
show that with oscillating electrical charges in a thermal bath, a large number of quanta may become condensed
into a single state, known as a Bose condensate, allowing long-range correlations amongst the dipoles involved.
He also proposed that bio-molecules with a high electric dipole moment line up along the actins filaments, and
that electric dipole oscillations propagate along these filaments in the form of quantum coherent waves. There is
some support for these ideas, in the form of experimental confirmation that bio-molecules with high electric
dipole moment have a periodic oscillation (Gray and Singer, 1989). The hypothesis of an individual double as
created by our mind Vitiello agrees with Frohlich in arguing that living system constitute ordered chains of
chemical reactions, which could normally be expected to collapse in the random chemical environment of
biological tissue. In Vitiello‘s view stable ordering comes from the quantum level, but this is described by
quantum field theory rather than quantum mechanics. He also claims that the folding of protein, which is
fundamental to the activity of cells, cannot be described by classical physics, but could be quantum ordered.

transfer via solitons and coherent excitations. QBD proposes that the cortical field not only interacts with, but
also to a good extent controls the neuronal network. It suggests that bio-molecular waves propagate along the
actin filaments, an important part of the cytoskeleton, particularly in the vicinity of the cell membrane and
dendritic spines. The waves derive energy from ATP molecules stored in the membrane, and these in turn are
controlled by calcium ions. These waves are also suggested to control the action of ion channels, which are
crucial in the transmission of signals to the synapses. The neurons membrane is further suggested to act as a
Josephson junction providing insulation between two layers of superconductivity. The superconductivity current
across the membrane can be controlled by the electrical potentials across the same membrane. Vitiello also
discusses the question of quantum de-coherence. He claims that QBD only requires quantum oscillations to last
10-14 picoseconds, which should be much shorter than the period required for de-coherence (Del Giudice, 1988,
2002). In common with Stuart Hameroff, he additionally argues that ordered water around protein molecules
may shield them from the surrounding thermal bath.
The concepts derive from the Japanese physicist, Hiroomi Umezawa1993 who speculated that
understanding the processes of memory in the brain would involve quantum field theory. This led onto the idea
that understanding consciousness would also involve quantum field theory. Meijer and Simon Raggett discuss
the dendritic network at length. They point out that it is much more sophisticated than the axonal network. The
dendritic membrane comprises bio-molecules with electric dipoles the positive poles of the membrane are
aligned on the inner surface and the negative poles on the outer surface. The negative poles on the outer surface
attract positive ions, while the positive poles on the inner surface attract negative ions. The regions where these
interactions occur are called Debye layers. The dendrites of several neurons are often entangled in a network.
Chemical synapses are located on the tips of dendritic spines and there are emphases on the dendritic
membranes. In such processes even quantum tunnelling may play a significant role. Since the 1970s, Evan
Harris Walker has proposed that quantum tunnelling of electrons would take place across junctions between
Neurons. Stuart Hameroff says that "... Gap junctions enable quantum tunnelling among dendrites ...".According
to the principles of modern physics: if a particle such as an electron encounters a barrier such as the synaptic
junction, there is a finite probability that the particle will ... be found on the other side. From the point of view of
Bohm‘s pilot wave quantum theory, Peter R. Holland says that quantum tunnelling is explained because the
effective barrier potential is not the classical barrier potential, but is the quantum potential. There is
experimental confirmation that bio-molecules of high electric dipole moment have a periodic oscillation
(Fröhlich, 1968) and suggest that these oscillations are crucial to the functioning of the brain. This can be called
wave cybernetics, because the wave or bio-molecule oscillation is seen as the controlling factor in the brain.
Frohlich proposed a theory where bio-molecules with high electric dipole moment line up along the actin
filaments immediately below the cell membrane, while electric dipole oscillations propagate along each filament
as coherent waves. These are maintained by electrons trapped in and moving along the protein molecules. This
is now known as a Frohlich wave. These waves exchange energy with the electromagnetic field. Stuart,
Umezawa, and Takahashi, 1978 proposed the idea of a cortical field. This interacts with the macroscopic
dynamics of the main neural network, which in turn transmits signals to the body tissues. The filamentous
strings found in the cells also extend outside the cells forming an extracellular matrix that is also linked to the
cell membrane. So the membrane proteins are linked both to the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
Meijer and Simon Raggett propose that Fröhlich waves propagate along the filamentous strings. The waves are
produced by energy stored in ATP molecules at membrane protein sites, which are in turn controlled by calcium
ions. The waves also effect the operation of ion channels, which control neural impulses. Also suggest that this
structure can give rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena, similar to superconductivity. They also regard the
cell membrane as an insulating layer between two areas of superconductivity, otherwise known as a Josephson
junction. This means that superconductivity current across the Josephson junction can be controlled by electric
potential differences in the insulating layer. He suggests that this quantum activity may facilitate the functioning
of the brain and in particular an interface between the proposed cortical field and the neurons network. The
cortical field is proposed to contain energy quanta behaving as particles, called corticons. Corticons are
suggested to exist everywhere in the cerebral cortex. The interface between the cortical field and the neuron
network takes place in the waves propagating along the filamentous strings in the cytoskeleton and the
extracellular matrix.
McFadden starts by stating that synchronous firing in the brain correlates with awareness and
perception indicating that disturbances in the brain‘s electromagnetic field also correlate with these. This field is
a representation of neuronal information and its dynamics could be seen as a correlate of consciousness.
McFadden, 2001views this field as the physical substrata of consciousness. The brain‘s electromagnetic field is
induced by neuron firing, and also the movement of ions involved in the fluctuation of electrical potential along
the cell membrane. The structure of the cortex tends to amplify the induced field. Experiments in the olfactory
bulb have demonstrated EEG activity in response to sensory stimuli. Information about the stimuli related to the
spatial pattern of the EEG amplitude.

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
We conclude that the brain contains a highly structured extracellular electromagnetic field. The field is
weak with the trans-membrane fields being about 3,000 times stronger. It is suggested that neurotransmission
through gap junctions may be voltage dependent and therefore sensitive to local fields. However, McFadden
prefers to concentrate on the voltage-gated ion channels in the cell membranes, because their role is better
understood. Synchonous firing is thought to due to a large number of spatially distributed neurons. It is thought
that many millions of neurons could be influenced by such firing. McFadden claims evidence for neuron
communication via the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field theory of consciousness is a part of the
integral electromagnetic spectrums. The medical use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is taken to
indicate the sensitivity of the brain to weak electromagnetic fields, and as this has impacts on behaviour, it is
argued to impact neuronal computation and neuronal function. Even when fields are weaker than the
surrounding noise, they can modulate neurons. The brain‘s electromagnetic field is argued to hold the same
information as the neuron firing patterns. The widespread of the electromagnetic field would help to explain the
unity of consciousness. He thinks that consciousness is not actually the electromagnetic field, but its ability to
transmit information to neurons. McFadden declares by fiat that one particular part of the otherwise ordinary
material of the brain produces consciousness. Again, it is reasonable to say that evolution selected for a
particular type of field that could fine tune the neurons, but the additional production of a feeling of free will,
which is false, has no demonstrable value.
It is very convenient to say about the participation of the neutral current occurs in the frame-work of
the super-unified group SU(11) [ SU(6)  SU(5)  U(1)], i.e. specially in the frame-work SU(6)  U(1), where
SU(6) having 35-bosons, out of which five bosons namely Jk3, Jk8, Jk15, Jk24, Jk35, corresponding to the five
diagonal matrices, thinks to plays a key role for the consciousness of the universe also for human consciousness.
The strong neutral current created by SU(6) with U(1) are likely to be compared with the weak interaction of
SU(2) with U(1) of the unified group SU(5) [ SU(3)  SU(2)  U(1)], where SU(2)does not directly involve
with electric, it still seems to demand charged bosons W1 and W2 . This circumstances prompted efforts to link it
with an electromagnetic interaction. This link achieved via SU(2)  U(1) frame-work originally proposed by A.
Salam and S. Weinberg and sometimes called the electro-weak interaction. The link brings the photon (which is
a boson), closer to three particles W1 , W2 & W3 , where W1 , W2 are two opposite charged particles and the
third (W3 ) neutral. In this unified picture it is more convenient to say that another neutral particle Z 0 instead
of, W3 Z 0 has zero mass and charge, just like the photon. However, the photon does not interact with the
neutrino while the Z 0 does. The exchange of Z 0 does not alter electric charge, and hence such an interaction is
called a neutral current interaction. Similarly, if we go beyond the standard model of physics i.e. in the
symmetry theory of SU(11), we see there are five neutral particles of the latent energy group SU(6), in which
two pairs, namely Jk3, Jk8 and Jk15, Jk24 were interchanged without any colour changes, but the neutral
particle Jk35, like as Z 0 also create a neutral current i.e. electromagnetic interaction through the frame-work
SU(6)U(1), called pseudo-electromagnetic interaction which may responsible for the consciousness sensory
with material weak electromagnetic interaction achieved by the frame-work of SU(2)  U(1). We observe that,
towards unification of SU(3), SU(2), U(1), the strength of weak force gradually increases while strength of
strong force gradually decreases and ultimately we found the unified group SU(5). So, in the theory of SU(11)
i.e. in another phase we found quark-like & lepton-like particles, which may be five times of each quark [ i.e. uquark, d-quark,…..etc. of the standard model of physics of the unified group SU(5) ] or each of five different
quarks [namely, {u1 , u2 ,….,u5 }-quarks, {d1 , d2 ,.….,d5 }-quarks,…etc.]. Thus Z 0 - like neutral particle of
SU(6) like zero mass & charges instead of Jk35 interact with other particles of SU(5) creating strong neutral
current with conscious sensory information system.
In the theoretical physics, we observe the flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC‘s) are hypothetical
expressions that change the flavour of a fermions current without altering its electric charge. If they occur in
nature (as reflected by Lagrangian interaction terms) these processes may induce phenomena that have not yet
been observed in experiment. Flavour-changing neutral currents may occur in the standard model beyond the
tree level, but they are highly suppressed by the GIM mechanism. FCNC‘s are generally predicted by theories
that attempt to go beyond the standard model, such as the models of Super-Symmetry or Technicolor. Their
suppression is necessary for an agreement with observations, making FCNC‘s important in model-building. The
Cemi-field theory conceives that the electromagnetic field in the brain fine tunes the probabilities of neuron
firings. The affected neurons may be a part of the larger connected assemblies, and this leads to memory and
learning. In simulated networks non-synaptic neuronal interactions via the electromagnetic field and also gap
junctions enhance learning. Modulation of long term potentiating by electromagnetic fields has also been
demonstrated in vitro in rat hippocampus slices.
Consciousness was a fundamental property of electrical charge, or individual charged particles, or the
photons that intermediate it, thus making it a primitive or a brute fact of the universe. Thus we can say that the
perception indicating that disturbance in the brain correlates with pseudo-electromagnetic field. The brain‘s
pseudo-electromagnetic field is induced by neuron firing, and also the movement of ions involved in the

fluctuation of electrical potential along the cell membrane. The structure of the cortex tends to amplify the
induced field. Experiments in the olfactory bulb have demonstrated EEG activity in response to sensory stimuli.
Information about the stimuli related to the spatial pattern of the EEG amplitude. Brain contains a highly
structured extra-cellular electromagnetic field. The field is weak with the trans-membrane fields being about
3,000 times stronger. It is suggested that neurotransmission through gap junctions may be voltage dependent and
therefore sensitive to local fields. Synchronous firing is thought to due to a large number of spatially distributed
neurons. It is thought that many millions of neurons could be influenced by such firing. McFadden claims
evidence for neuron communication via the electromagnetic field. The medical use of trans-cranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) is taken to indicate the sensitivity of the brain to weak electromagnetic fields, and as this has
impacts on behaviour, it is argued to impact neuronal computation and neuronal function. Even when fields are
weaker than the surrounding noise, they can modulate neurons. The brain‘s electromagnetic field is argued to
hold the same information as the neuron firing patterns. The widespread of the electromagnetic field would help
to explain the unity of consciousness. The high conductivity of the cerebral fluid in the brain ventricles makes
the brain into a kind of Faraday‘s cage, insulating it from external electrical fields. However, it is much easier
for magnetic fields to penetrate the brain and other tissues. Moving magnetic fields such as those used in TMS
do produce effects in the brain.

IX.

Role Of Dendrites For Consciousness

Romijn views the brain as a chaotic self-organising process, the outcome of which is the pattern of
electric and magnetic fields generated by the dendritic trees of neurons. Virtual photons comprise the electric
and magnetic fields and it is these which are claimed to encode conscious experience. Romijn argues that they
are causally necessary and sufficient for consciousness. He takes an initially conventional approach in pointing
out that brain scan studies show a correlation between neural activity and subjective experiences (Raichle, 1998;
Schacter et al, 1998). Thus he takes the view that subjective experience is as real for the brain scan activity is for
the third party investigator.
Romijn discusses the detailed behaviour of dendrites. When a dendrite receives a signal from another
neuron there is a depolarisation of the membrane, in the case of an excitatory signal, and hyperpolarisation in
the event of an inhibitory signal. This creates an electric field between the part of the dendrite membrane that
has become polarised or hyperpolarised and the rest of the membrane. The greater part of the electric field will
flow towards the cell body and the axon hillock because the dendrite is thicker in that direction. This action
along the dendrite also generates a magnetic field. The dendritic tree has been shown to use several different
forms of information processing. At the synapse the incoming pattern of action potentials determines which of
various neurotransmitters stored there are released. On the dendritic side, receptors are sensitive to particular
neurotransmitters. The receptors are clustered in complex spatial patterns. Receptors can modulate each other
performance. Outside the synaptic cleft, the extracellular fluid has a low concentration of ions, neurotransmitters
and hormones that may exert a synchronising effect between neurons. Studies have shown that the dendritic tree
can detect the individual discharge of synapses and has mechanisms for amplifying the signal to noise ratio.
Dendritic spines provide the postsynaptic contact sites for 80% of excitatory synapses. Spines can change their
shape in a period of milliseconds, which changes the flow of information into the dendrites.
Romijn points out that synaptic transmission are probabilistic. When an action potential reaches a
synapse, there is no certainty that the synapse will fire. There is only a probability, of between 30% and 80%,
depending on the type of synapse that it will fire. In some studies (Lehman et al, 1998; Zeki & Bartels, 1998),
field configurations, which had to remain stable in the cortex for a minimal time such as 120 ms were related to
various types of mental activity. Shorter lived fields are thought to relate to the unconscious level. The electrical
and magnetic fields are seen as having a vast number of possible semi-stable configurations they can take up in
response to either external stimuli or existing memories (Sakai & Miyashita, 1994) and Tononi et al, 2008).
These fields formed out of virtual photons, the intermediating particle/waves of the electromagnetic force, are
deemed to be the carriers of consciousness in the brain.
Protein molecules constitute ion channels, receptors and enzymes and have electrically charged groups
held together by vander Waals forces. These electrostatic binding forces determine the tertiary structure of
proteins, and hence some of their properties. The ions, receptors and enzymes experience fluctuations as a result
of the electrical field around the dendrite (Fröhlich, 1975, Goodman et al, 1995). It has been shown that
postsynaptic receptor and ion distribution continually undergoes non-linear changes because of the synaptic
electric fields. All this means that the dendritic tree has the ability to tune itself to the inflow of information,
which in turn results in ordered electric and magnetic fields.

X.

Ion Channel Coherence Of Gustav Bernroider

Ion channels are a crucial component in the axonal spiking/synaptic firing model of neuronal signalling
and information processing. The axonal signal starts from the body of the neuron and proceeds down an

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
extension called the axon, by means of a fluctuation in the difference in electrical potential across the membrane
that forms the exterior of the axon. The membrane is formed by a double layer of lipids. The ion channels
consist of protein molecules inserted through the lipid bi-layer. The axon fires when sodium (𝑵𝒂+ ) ions flow in
through one set of ion channels, and subsequently returns to its resting state when potassium (𝑲+ ) ions flow out
through another set of ion channels. This process continues down the length of the axon until it reaches the
synapse which it allows to fire, and thus communicates with other neurons. Ion channels are thus a key
mechanism in the brain‘s signalling and information processing. Bernroider and Roy‘s calculations claim that
ion permeation can only be understood at the quantum level. Their calculations suggest that the 𝑲+ ions and the
carboxyl atoms of the binding pockets are two quantum-entangled sub-systems, and they equate this to a
quantum computational mapping. In a later paper, presented at the Quantum Mind conference, Bernroider, 2007,
proposed that different ion channels could be non-locally entangled, thus proposing a quantum process over an
extended area of the axon. Given the importance of the ion channels in brain functioning, this model would give
quantum coherence and non-locality in the axon membrane an integral role in the brain‘s signalling and
information processing. Further to this, Bernroider and Roy have pointed out a similarity between the structure
of the 𝑲+ ion channel and some recent proposals for making quantum computers, in which ions are held in
microscopic traps. They also propose a quantum information system in the brain that is driven by the entangled
ion states in the voltage-gated ion channels. These ion channels, situated in the
Neuron membranes are a crucial component of the conventional neuroscience description of axon
spiking leading to neural transmitter release at the synapses. The ion channels allow the influx and out flux of
ions from the cell driving the fluctuation of electrical potential along the axon, which in turn provides the
necessary signal to the synapse. Recent progress in atomic-level spectroscopy of the membrane proteins that
constitute the ion channels and the accompanying molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the organisation
of the membrane proteins carries a logical coding potency, and also implies quantum entanglement within ion
channels and possibly also between different ion channels. An increasing number of studies show that proteins
surrounding membrane lipids are associated with the probabilistic nature of the gating of the ion channels.
Bernroider‘s theory might be seen to represent even more of a challenge to conventional neuroscience than the
other quantum consciousness theories. This is because its recruits as its basis the axon membrane and ion
channels which form a crucial part of the conventional neuroscience model, and then tries to remodel these core
structures on a quantum-driven basis. It is hard to deny that if this theory were to become better substantiated, it
would produce in neuroscience a revolution of the most profound kind. The interaction between ions, attracted
water molecules and neighbouring oxygen atoms is considered to require a quantum description. This raises the
question of whether quantum effects can propagate in the classical states of proteins. The access of ions to the
pore gate is a relatively slow process not likely to require quantum processing. However, the selectivity filter
can change its conformation from permissive to non-permissive on a much shorter timescale. It appears that in
the conditions of the selectivity filter the ion‘s wave function can become highly delocalized over a significant
part of the filter region. Bernroider‘s theory could potentially be a vehicle for transferring consciousness from
implicate into the explicate order of David Bohm. Bernroider differs from Penrose and Hameroff‘s Orch OR
model in his emphasis of the axons and membranes, as opposed to the dendrites and the cytoskeleton. However,
there are similarities between the two models in that both of them propose quantum coherence, non-locality and
subsequent wave function collapse linked to the brain‘s macroscopic information processing activity. As it
stands, Bernroider‘s proposals only deal with information processing in the brain rather than consciousness as
such. However, it appears possible that wave function collapse in the ion channels might link to Penrose‘s
proposed geometry of space-time, just as readily as wave function collapse in the cytoskeleton. Chris King,
1989, 2003 2011, 2012, 2014, favours the approach of Chalmers over the approach of Dennett in looking at the
problem of consciousness. .King favours the transactional interpretation of EPR type nonlocal quantum
correlations. In his article: The transactional interpretation visualizes an exchanged particle wave function as the
interference of a retarded usual time direction offer wave and a time-reversed advanced confirmation wave.
Time symmetric interactions also occur in quantum field theories where special relativity allows both advanced
and retarded solutions because of the energy relation E = ± 𝒑𝟐 + 𝒎𝟐 , Virtual photons and electron-positron pairs
deflecting an electron in quantum electrodynamics. Since the photon is its own anti-particle, a negative energy
photon travelling backwards in time is precisely a positive energy one travelling forwards. In quantum
mechanics, not only are all probability paths traced in the wave function, but past and future are interconnected
in a time-symmetric hand-shaking relationship, so that the final states of a wave-particle or entangled ensemble,
on absorption, are boundary conditions for the interaction, just as the initial states that created them. The
transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics expresses this relationship neatly in terms of offer waves
from the past emitter/s and confirmation waves from the future absorbers, whose wave interference becomes the
single or entangled particles passing between. When an entangled pairs are created, each knows instantaneously
the state of the other and if one is found to be in a given state, e.g. of polarization or spin, the other is
immediately in the complementary state no matter how far away it is in space-time. This is the spooky action at

a distance, which Einstein feared because it violates local Einsteinium causality in which particles not
communicating faster than the speed of light. Weak quantum measurement (Aharonov et al. 2010) is a process
where a quantum wave function is not irreversibly collapsed by absorbing the particle but a small deformation is
made in the wave function whose effects become apparent later when the particle is eventually absorbed e.g. on
a photographic plate in a strong quantum measurement. Weak quantum measurement changes the wave function
slightly mid-flight between emission and absorption, and hence before the particle meets the future absorber
involved in eventual detection. A small change is induced in the wave function, e.g. by slightly altering its
polarization along a given axis (Kocsis et al. 2011). This cannot be used to deduce the state of a given waveparticle at the time of measurement because the wave function is only slightly perturbed, and is not collapsed or
absorbed, as in strong measurement, but one can build up a prediction statistically over many repeated quanta of
the conditions at the point of weak measurement, once post-selection data is assembled after absorption. This
suggests (Merali, 2010, Cho, 2011) that, in some sense, the future is determining the present, but in a way we
can discover conclusively only by many repeats. Again, according to King that for good adaptive reasons, the
brain goes beyond the brute force of quantum computing, to achieve intuitive decisions and creativity both of
which involves subjective consciousness. These ideas appear to be similar in spirit to the Penrose concept of
non-computability. In general computation seeks a single outcome while creative activity and some other
behaviours, seeks diversity. Chaotic excitability is suggested as one of the earliest features of eukaryote cells.
This would allow the single cell to get feedback from the environment, rather than becoming stuck in a
particular and unsatisfactory oscillation. The behaviour of single cell organisms in being able to navigate and
behave adaptively in their environment is in any case a problem for cognitive theory. The human brain also
exhibits a fractal structure, that forms a suitable platform for chaotic (non-linear ) reception and expression of
neuronal activity.
King formulates several ultimate questions:a) Is there any intrinsic meaning to life, or is it we ourselves, as living beings, who express the meaning by
unfolding it in our creative lives as conscious participants?
b) Is there world heading for an apocalyptic falling out and a triage of nature caused by a failure to protect our
generations own futures, or is the entire universe evolving towards a state of ever-deepening realization and
enlightenment?
c) Is the fulfilment of life in the universe found in some future ultimate state of enlightenment, or is it
expressed eternally across space-time in the consciousness of all sentient beings who will come to witness
or have witnessed the ongoing existential condition, who together bring about the historical evolution of the
conscious universe?
The answers is nothing but some kind of new quantum energy transfers from the past infinite discrete universe
to the present our created physical universe with splitting into spirit stuff & physical stuff and working in the
process like entanglement.

Explanation About Quantum Consciousness

Scaruffi‘s provides an outline of the main theories of quantum consciousness. Quantum models of
consciousness date back to the 1920‘s and the birth of quantum theory itself. However, the earliest detailed
model appears to have been produced by Evan Walker, 2000 already in 1970. This proposed that electrons could
quantum tunnel between adjacent neurons to produce a virtual nervous system that direct the synapse-based
system. The idea finds echoes in the later Penrose/Hameroff model, where Hameroff suggests that quantum
states can extend across macroscopic areas of the brain, as a result of quantum tunnelling at gap junctions
linking the dendrites of different neurons.
The physicist, Herbert Fröhlich, 1989, suggested that a quantum phenomenon called Bose-Einstein
condensation could arise in biological matter. Living matter comprises mainly water and bio-molecules, both of
which are electrical dipoles. It is suggested that when such oscillators are maintained at a constant temperature,
as they are in the thermal non-equilibrium of biological tissue, condensates can arise. These may also encode
information and transmit signals. At a later date, the Penrose/Hameroff model also used condensates, which in
conjunction with quantum tunnelling at gap junctions allowed quantum states to extend over macroscopic areas
of the brain. In 1989, Ian Marshall also suggested that consciousness could arise from the excitation of
condensates in the brain. Also Scaruffi discusses the position of Karl Pribram, 1991, who considers that brain
processes have many of the properties of holograms. Sensory perception is seen as electromagnetic activation
propagating through the brain. These sensory waves can interfere with memory also propagating as a wave to
produce a holographic structure. Perceptions can be analysed into component frequencies, and therefore dealt
with by Fourier analyse. Dirac‘s least action principle constrains the trajectories of these waves.
In looking at the synapses between neurons, particular attention to the metabotropic links, as distinct
from the ion tropic links that take the form of electrical signals via membrane ion channels. With the

metabotropic links, neurotransmitters bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). These activate second
messengers, which in turn act on protein kinesis and phosphatises that modulate the cytoskeleton. The
cytoskeleton in its turn signals protein production requirements to the nucleus of the cell. The fast electrical
activity of the ion channels is contrasted with the slower biochemical processes within the neuron. Georgiev
says that the Hameroff model only takes account of the biochemical and not the electrical activity. He disagrees
with this exclusion of electrical activity, pointing out that Penfield‘s ground breaking research in the mid 20th
century showed that conscious memories could be evoked by inserting electrodes into parts of the cortex.
Consciousness itself must be an intrinsic physical property (Scaruffi, 2001), rather than something that
is created by other physical components. He compares those neuroscientists who do not accept this, to a scientist
that did not accept that electrical charge is a fundamental property, but tried to explain it in terms of some other
property such as gravity. He takes the view that any paradigm that tries to manufacture consciousness out of
something else is doomed to failure. In such a paradigm, consciousness will seem to appear by magic by putting
neurons or similar components which have no sign of consciousness in their make up together. He says that his
theory is neither dualist nor reductionist. Consciousness is seen as separate from physical science as described,
but still a physical property. This approach seems close to a physical defined panpsychism. The development of
molecular biology during the latter part of the 20th century made it clear that neurons were highly complex, and
from this it became apparent that features such as memory and some diseases such as dementias might be better
understood in terms of molecular changes within the neurons. In these cases, it has been shown that not only are
there changes in neuronal firing, but also in cytoskeleton organization, the cytoskeleton being composed of biomolecules that are the basis of life. The DNA of the cell nucleus contains essential information, but is viewed
here as being driven by the transfer of information from the cytoskeleton.
Hupin Hu & Maoxin Wu, 2004, 2010, says that networks of nuclear spins in neural membranes are
associated with strongly fluctuating magnetic fields that are modulated by the indirect dipole-to-dipole coupling
in action potentials. Interactions between two nuclear spins result indirectly from the interactions of electrons
around the nuclei. Hu and Wu found that these couplings had frequencies of 5-25 Hz, which are within the EEG
range of activity. They predicted that magnetic fields associated with spin-related coupling across the cell
membrane would have an energy value equivalent to photon emission. By Persinger et al, 2013 that the
underlying spin networks could be linked to photon emissions observed with particular brain activities. The
energies available to the neuronal membrane are suggested to be within the range associated with photon
emission, and therefore capable of interacted with it or altering it. A recent study showed that photon emissions
from cell cultures were mainly emitted from cell membranes. Another study showed that photon emissions in
brain tissue varied strongly, when the tissue was either oxygen deprived, or alternatively exposed to pure
oxygen. It was found that the intensity of emissions from the right hemisphere of the brain were correlated with
EEG activity over the left prefrontal, when the subjects were imagining white light, but not at other times.
Another study by Dotta and Persinger, 2011 looked at the behaviour of the para-hippocampalgyrei in both
hemispheres, when light was imagine by the subject, there was a marked increase in power in the delta, beta and
gamma bands associated with activation of the para-hippocampalgyrei. Photon emissions were elevated in the
16-17 Hz range, while the subject imagined light, and this corresponds to the range of proton couplings
predicted by Hu and Wu, 2004.

XII.

Photon And Electric Charge-Mediated Consciousness

Romijn, 1997 puts forward the concept that subjectivity or consciousness is coded into the virtual
photons that generate electric and magnetic fields. This approach has considerable advantages. Photons intermediating the electromagnetic force are, as far as we know, the most basic level of the universe. At this level the
fundamental components of the universe have given properties that cannot be explained, analysed or reduced
further. So both the charge on the electron and the ability of the photon to intermediate it across space are given
properties that cannot be explained or reduced. This is the only physical level at which it is possible to have
properties that cannot be reduced to something more fundamental.
The article suggests that photons carry subjectivity or consciousness as such a given property. This is in
principle possible because irreducible properties are present at this level. It is more reasonable than the
mainstream approach, which suggests that a new property of consciousness can be produced by banging
together previously unconscious bits of matter. The problem would be the same if we tried to say that electrical
charge was a function of banging things together in some complex system. It might look plausible, but we
would forever be looking for what actually happened that produced the charge. Although subjectivity is present
at the level of photons, it requires brain systems to generate ordered patterns that are the basis of actual
conscious experience.
The change of a larger group SU(11) of symmetries to the subgroup SU(6) SU(5) U(1) is
spontaneous by the redistribution of energy particles of stages like gaseous as explained before. The above

particles) that have the characteristics like a magnetic mono-pole. Typically, the mass of which (in energy units)
may be ~ 𝟏𝟎𝟏𝟗 Gev (Plank energy). Monopoles like charge particles are highly stable particles and once created
are not destructible. And so they would survive as relics to the present epoch. The explanation of the two energy
groups SU(5) and SU(6) of the SUT energy group SU(11), we begin with the analogy of ferromagnetism and
crucial role of the Curie-temperature (𝟕𝟕𝟎𝟎 𝑪 for iron). Above this temperature a bar of iron shows no
magnetism in an external field. This is because its elementary nuclear magnets are randomly aligned with no
resultant magnetization. Energetically, this is the lowest state for the bar and it chooses to remain in that state as
the most stable one. Bellow the Curie temperature the state of lowest energy changes to that in which all the
nuclei are aligned along the bar, which develops polarity at its ends. There are two states of the same lowest
energy possible, depending on which (north or south) of the two poles falls at a given end. The ultimate choice
of one state apparently breaks symmetry although theoretically and inherently the symmetry is always there. In
the early universe something similar happened to the super unified theory SU(11) and then SU(5). Above like a
critical temperature 𝑻𝒄 , the vacuum state, the state of lowest energy, is none other than the potential φ = 0.
Below 𝑻𝒄 , the states of lowest energy of the thermo-statistical particles are changed. It now corresponds to a
situation when φ has non-zero values. Corresponding to states of the same lowest energy, let us suppose that
there exist alternative values 𝝋𝒊 (i =1, 2, 3,....) which now acquire that status of vacuum. There were basic
symmetry with respect to all 𝝋𝒊 , but in practice the system may spontaneously acquire one of them. This is
again an apparent break-down of symmetry. The consequences of this for the very early universe are that it is
divided into different domains, each with a different value of 𝝋𝒊 . In this way the universe acquires
discontinuities along the domain walls. These translate into highly significant discontinuities of matter
distribution. The fact that we do not see such discontinuities in actuality (say in the form of large sheets of
matter) is hard to explain away. This difficulty is known as the domain wall problem. The intersection of two
domain walls is a linear structure known as ―cosmic-string‖ such filamentary structure have been invoked in
scenarios for galaxy form.

Recent Experiments On Photon-Mediated Consciousness

Recent experiments confirm Romijn‘s ideas in the sense that a bio-photon coherent system may
constitute an ultra rapid communication system not only in the brain but also functioning in the whole organism,
explaining the amazing concerted actions of complex living organisms. Regarding the biophysical visual
representation idea, it should be stressed that the phrase ―ultra-weak bio-photon emission‖ is confusing, as it
suggests that ultra-weak bio-photons are not important in cellular mechanisms but are by-products of free
radical reactions. In contrasts externally measured ultra-weak bio-photon emission from cells and neurons is
principally produced from natural oxidation processes on the surfaces of cellular membranes as demonstrated by
Blake et al. 2011.
However, the real bio-photon intensity, as produced in mitochondria, as well as DNA/RNA, can be
fundamentally higher inside cells and neurons (Bókkon et al., 2010) compared with the bio-photon intensity in
their surrounding environment which makes it possible for the emergence of intrinsic biophysical pictures in V1
visual areas. Long-term visual memories may not store as biophysical pictures but as red-ox regulated
epigenetic codes. During visual imagery, top-down processes trigger and regulate the epigenetic encoded longterm visual information. Next, according to retrieved neural epigenetic information, mitochondrial networks in
synchronized neurons generate patterns of bio-photons through red-ox reactions, which can produce intrinsic
biophysical pictures in retinotopic and mitochondrial rich visual neurons during visual imagery, REMS
associated dreams or visual hallucination (Bókkon, 2009; Bókkon and D'Angiulli, 2009; Bókkon et al., 2010a).
First bio-photon experiments may support our biophysical pictures representation. Namely, Dotta and Persinger,
(2011) and Dotta et al. (2012) observed cognitive coupling with bio-photon emission in the brain during
subjective visual imagery were strongly correlated with EEG activity and the emergence of action potentials in
axons. In addition, Sun et al., (2010), revealed that bio-photons can conduct along the neural fibres which
supports this biophysical picture hypothesis. It appears that bio-photonic and bio-electronic activities are not
independent biological processes in the nervous system, and their synergistic action may play a significant role
in neural signal processes.
Basically, any charge in elementary matter, may distort, or "polarize" the quantum vacuum in the
immediate vicinity, through attracting virtual particles with opposite electrical charges and repel virtual particles
with similar electrical charges. In quantum field theory, the fabric of space is visualized as consisting of field,
that at every point in space and time exhibit a quantum harmonic oscillator, interacting with neighbouring
oscillators. Further, and also critically importantly, the wave solutions are in pairs. This means that whenever
the phase arrangements of intersecting plane waves produce an electron, they will also necessarily produce the
opposite phase positron next to it (they will also have opposite spin states). This explains matter-antimatter pair
production, which is occurring everywhere in space all the time, because space vibrates in two distinct patterns
(particles and quantum fields) that are constantly switching. Splendid work on teleportation, both in theory and

The Complex Quantum-State of Consciousness
experiment as reported in Nature by Sudbury (1997) and Bouwmeester et al. (1997) and in line with the work by
Marcer and Schempp (1997), makes it clear that non-local quantum information represented by entanglement of
particles in this field could be recovered locally as useable information.
We have from the ―Noetic Field Theory‖ of Amoroso et al. (1999), vacuum (zero-point) quantum
fluctuations and gravitation, introduced as potential mechanisms explaining non-local information exchange. So
called noetic effects coupled operators of a noetic field to specific loci of pumped Frohlich-like coherent states.
This was seen as a phase regulator into the patterns of Pribram's holonomic formations. The pumping
mechanism for this process is inherent in the self organization of the system. The radiation pressure of the Bose
states, Fermi-quasi-particle transitions, vacuum zero point fluctuations, and string dynamics are considered to be
instrumental in driving this dynamic transpersonal 'memory of being'. This was supposed to be a dynamic
Hilbert space storing archetypal forms of the personality or psyche. The force carrier of the electromagnetic
field is the photon. At a microscopic level, therefore, the interaction between the constituent particles of matter
and the quantum vacuum involves photons being exchanged between the virtual particles of the vacuum, we
consider the photons belong to the energy group SU(6) created in the previous (first stage) phase, with a pseudoelectromagnetic interactions by exchanging 30-bosons of SU(6) into 30-bosons of SU(5) or vice-versa, also
producing the quark-like particles which transfer into the matter particles of the group SU(5) by creating quarks,
electrons etc.
Of note, if we assume a collective storage of all information that is present and/or evolves in our
Universe and that human and other intelligent species in the cosmos interact with such a knowledge field, it
intrinsically implies that it cannot be solely treated as a by-product of our brain and intelligence in general. At
first sight this conflicts with current mainstream science and conventional pictures of reality. However the
following may show that in fact there is solid ground and even overwhelming evidence for the
hypothesis/concept of a universal knowledge field. These considerations are based on the current descriptions of
nature on the micro level (string and spin theories), quantum mechanical concepts (such as entanglement, nonlocality and resonance), cosmological models on energy (zero point energy and negative energy, we may
consider as pseudo/latent energy explained above) as well as holographic concepts of reality and space/time
modalities. In addition, universal consciousness can be approached from transcendental human experience,
including transpersonal consciousness and should be discussed against a meta-physical background, also in
relation to the phenomenon of consciousness and self-consciousness as well as information theory.
Penrose, 1989, proposed that spin networks could be fundamental in the description of space-time in a
background lacking manner. In the brain, spin-networks were pictured as electron-unpaired electron spins that
represent pixels, collectively forming a ―mind screen‖ that is known to be highly sensitive to fluctuating internal
magnetic fields and action potentials. Such perturbations were considered to modulate neural dynamics, but also
could enhance synchronization and stochastic resonance as have been noticed in brain (Hu and Wu, 2004). The
particular spin chemistry bridges classical neural activity, serving as input via the magnetic influences on
biochemical processing. The proper information integration, transmission and exchange with outer information
domains require a guided interactive quantum process, in which the classical separation of sender and receiver is
overcome through an act of measurement and/or proper resonance with the information source. This implicitly
should be based on the phenomenon of entanglement and consequently on unitary and conscious field properties
of the neural and exo-systems (McFadden, 2007, John, 2001, Bohm and Hiley, 1987). This allows the
continuous exchange of meaningful information with global magnetic fields as proposed by McFadden, 2007
and Burke and Persinger, 2013 and/or a universal quantum knowledge field as earlier proposed by Bohm and
Hiley, 1987). The implicate order concept was suggested to also contain personal information [our mental
double in the universal consciousness domain, (Vitiello, 1995)]. In order to operate in a conscious as well as
sub-conscious modes and also to enable modalities of self consciousness, it was proposed that apart from the
known four dimensions at least one or two imaginary dimensions are required (Carter 2013 a and b, Smythies,
2003). In my theory ―The Origin of Consciousness in the Universe- IOSR‖ was explained that our reasonable
universe are actually 10-dimensional space-time, where appeared the universe from (10 to 7) dimensional flat
universe which are non-adiabatic stage, then (6 to 5)-dimensional closed universe and the stages arises are
adiabatic, then our so called real/physical universe i.e. 4-dimensional Einstein‘s universe. Feeling of
consciousness activity may associated with 6 and, or 5-dimensional space-time.
Mathematician Shor, 1996 proved a quantum error correction theorem for quantum computers. If
quantum degrees of freedom in a quantum computer are de-cohering due to loss of phase information from the
computer (the system) to its environment, then Shor showed that if information is added to the system from the
outside, the de-cohering degrees of freedom could be made to re-cohere again. Re-coherence can occur, for
instance, being driven by coherent electromagnetic field whose intensity and period distribution can be tuned
non-randomly, thereby injecting information that results in a new controlled superposition state (Kauffman,
2012b). This clearly says that re-coherence is, in principle, possible. This idea finds support in the papers of

physicist Briegel, 2006 showing that a quantum coherent "entangled" system can de-cohere to class city than recohere to quantum entangled coherence.
In looking for such a system, Vattay et al, 2012, examined the recent research on quantum properties of
photosynthetic systems (reviewed by Arndt, 2010, Lloyd, 2012). In photosynthesis photons are captured by the
chlorophyll molecule that is held by antenna protein. The chlorophyll molecule maintains quantum coherence
for up to 750 femto-seconds. This is much longer than the classical prediction, and is viewed as responsible for
higher than classically predicted efficiency of energy transfer. The particular antenna protein plays a role in
preventing more rapid de-coherence, or in inducing re-coherence in de-cohering parts of the chlorophyll
molecule. Part of the quantum system may start to de-cohere, but be forced back into coherence, described by
the abovementioned quantum error correction. Kauffman thinks that this raises the possibility that webs of
quantum coherence or partial coherence can extend across a large part of a neuron, and can remain poised
between coherence and de-coherence.
In relating quantum coherence to consciousness, Kauffman assumes like Hameroff , that coherence
would have to be sustained for the milliseconds timescales associated with neural processing, rather than the
femto- and pico-second timescales associated with quantum coherence in photosynthetic organisms. The process
of photon quantum teleportation (Salari et al., 2010), have been suggested for long distance signalling in the
brain, a process that both employs classical and quantum elements. Ehresmann et al., 2011, stresses the dynamic
character of a multi-scale flexible brain structure, varying over time and with a hierarchy of complexification
levels, in which higher cognitive and mental processes can develop. This occurs within a 5-dimensional global
landscape with retrospective and prospective elements that, among others, result in changes in the
synchronization of neuronal assemblies as well as dynamic adoption of neuronal contacts. In this sense the
dynamic flow of information in the brain may mirror the circular flow as it occurs from the micro-to macro scale
in the whole universe and vice versa. Such a multidimensional space-time brain structure, being open to external
electromagnetic and quantum fields, could also provide an interpretation framework for understanding of the,
until now, non-comprehensible time delays in subconscious and conscious perception, the inner knowing of
qualia as well as the subjective experience of transpersonal and extra-sensory events such as intuition,
serendipity, clairvoyance and telepathy ( Libet, 2001, 2006, Jahn and Dunne, 2004).

About Zero-Point Energy

Zero-point energy is the energy that remains when all other energy is removed from a system. Zeropoint energy was experimentally demonstrated with the so called Casimir Effect, a unique attractive quantum
force between closely-spaced metal plates. Casimir force was shown to be due to radiation pressure from the
background electromagnetic zero-point energy which has become unbalanced due to the presence of the plates,
and which results in the plates being pushed together. Electromagnetic radiation can be pictured as waves
flowing through space at the speed of light. The waves are not waves of anything substantive, but are ripples in
a state of a theoretically defined field. However these waves do carry energy (and momentum), and each wave
has a specific direction, frequency and polarization state. Each wave represents a ''propagating mode of the
electromagnetic field.'' Each mode is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator and is thus subject to the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle. From this line of reasoning, quantum physics predicts that all of space must be filled with
electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations (also called the zero-point field) creating a universal sea of zero-point
energy. Thus, it is clear from the explanation that our universe appeared from something instead of nothing
assumed by Einstein. According to my explanation in the previous articles, that means from Big-Rip singularity
to 11-dimensional space-time the universe remained in the stage which may compared with the state like gases.
The density of this energy depends critically on where in frequency the zero-point fluctuations cease. Since
space itself is thought to break up into a kind of quantum foam at a tiny distance scale called the Planck scale
(𝟏𝟎−𝟑𝟑 𝐜𝐦), it is argued that the zero point fluctuations must cease at a corresponding Planck frequency
(𝟏𝟎𝟒𝟑 Hz). If that is the case, the zero-point energy density would be 110 orders of magnitude greater than the
radiant energy at the centre of the Sun).
Zero-point energy has the desired property of driving an accelerated expansion, and thus having the
requisite properties of dark energy, but to an absurdly greater degree than required, i.e. 120 orders of magnitude.
Work by Christian Beck, and Michael Mackey, 2006 may have resolved the 120 order of magnitude problem. In
that case dark energy is nothing other than zero-point energy. In ―Measure-ability of vacuum fluctuations and
dark energy‖ and ―Electromagnetic dark energy‖ they propose that a phase transition occurs so that zero-point
photons below a frequency of about 1.7 THz are gravitationally active whereas above that they are not. If this is
the case, then the dark energy problem is solved: dark energy is the low frequency gravitationally active
component of zero-point energy. SED studies published in the 1990s showed that a mass-less point-charge
oscillator accelerating through the zero-point field will experience a Lorentz force (from the magnetic
components of the zero-point fluctuations) that turns out to be directly proportional to acceleration, allowing the
derivation of the fundamental F = ma relationship of mechanics from electrodynamics. That points to the

electromagnetic quantum vacuum as the origin of forces which appear as inertial mass. It was said by Andrei
Linde, 2005 that our knowledge of the world begins not with matter but with perceptions. It is possible that
consciousness, like space-time has its own degrees of freedom and that neglecting it leads to a description of the
universe that is fundamentally incomplete. He finally stated: all matter in the universe was produced with
quantum fluctuations after the end of inflation. Quantum effects combined with inflation made the universe not
only infinitely large but also immortal and afforded a beautiful and self-consistent pattern.

Actual Source Of Information Field

Excellent articles of Amit Goswami, 2005. ―Morphogenesis‖, the growth of a complete organism from
a single cell embryo, is a phenomenon of biological order of unprecedented precision timing of correlated events
of both spatial and temporal nature. One doesn't see anything like this in dealing with inanimate matter.
Naturally, beginning with Erwin Schrodinger, 1959, 1986, an impressive group of scientists have suggested that
the currently known laws of physics may not be enough to explain morphogenesis. Many biologists have
propounded the idea of a morphogenetic field -- a condition of space that retains the memory of the form that
the embryo evolves towards under the guidance of the fields. Sheldrake, 2005 proposed morphogenesis has
overtones of teleology to many. One has recently injected new principles in the old idea of morphogenetic fields
to incorporate teleology, non-locality, and downward causation. Sheldrake‘s morphogenetic fields are purposive
and non-local. They are not material as we understand. They are capable of downward causation in matter
through a new principle called "morphic resonance". As soon as a new form comes about, it sets up its own field
which is continually reinforced with its ongoing replication, thus explaining the memory exhibited in
morphogenesis. However, there is the fundamental question of the source of the morphogenetic fields that
resonate with matter, since this exhibits an implicit dualism. Morphogenesis can be given sound footing on the
basis of Quantum principles applied in the conceptualization of the living cell within the context of a new
science -- science within consciousness, a science based on the primacy of consciousness. This will take up the
necessity of a new formulation of biology within the primacy of consciousness and indicate how morphogenesis
theory is a precursor and a special case of this new theory. The question of experimental verification is
necessarily required. In this circumstances we introduce a generalise conception about the series of new energy
sources SU(6), SU(12)...etc. We consider that our present universe was appeared by a long process of the
symmetry breaking from infinite space-time, mathematically it was explained by the theory of Gaussian
transformation law of energy groups. After the symmetry breaking of SU(11), the 10-dimensional space-time
created the first stage of dark matter phases whose realisation as the consciousness and which is controlling the
whole universe of the second stage that means our physical universe or so called 4-dimensional universe and
creating a pseudo-electromagnetic interaction field producing a neutral current flow which affected everything
of our universe including biological particles and hence created a ―morphic resonance‖. Therefore,
morphogenesis is non-local. It is very interesting that within the standard model of physics we get a ―weak
neutral current‖ by one neutral particle of SU(2) of zero mass and charge by interaction with U(1). Similarly we
found another strong neutral current by the interaction of SU(6) with U(1). Experimentally, European research
centre ―CERN‖ confirmed that there exist a ―Flavour changing neutral current‖. So, it may be compared with a
magnet that if we cut the magnet that generates magnetic field, we get two of the same type magnetic fields--that means two halves of the original one.
Indeed, with these properties of morphic fields, (a) downward causation and purposiveness, (b) nonlocality and (c) morphic resonance with memory property all of the difficulties of biological morphogenesis of
materialist theories are resolved. But morphic field theories, seemingly has an implicit dualism, if postulated to
transcend matter. They are capable of influencing matter. Resonance phenomenon in radio needs
electromagnetic wave propagation between a source and a receptor. In this theory, there is the receptor (the
living object) and there is the information being received (the morphogenetic fields). Here we consider the
source of morphogenetic information is due to the latent (or pseudo) energy group SU(6) of the first stage,
which creates some inherent characters in nature and mind of the living things called intelligences. This
intelligence expressed by consciousness itself, looked upon as the ground of all being. Consciousness acts on
matter in conjunction with a vital body that contains the blueprints of biological forms. That is the source of
morphic information. And the function of morphic fields and resonance is carried out by consciousness
simultaneously choosing actuality from possibility forms of both the vital and the physical body of an organism.
And yet, this process does not involve dualism. Instead, the process involves self-referential quantum
measurement. In science within consciousness, we propose that there is a creative programmer--consciousness
itself. Consciousness is creative and changes the contexts of learning in the programs of the living cell. Not only
is morphogenesis explainable with this hypothesis but also is the evolution of new forms. And not only
morphogenesis and evolution, but the door is also opened to understand Life itself as a manifestation of
consciousness as different from insentient matter. Such type of consciousness may arise from the Gaussian
energy groups SU(12), SU(24),...etc., involving with the infinite number of extra-dimensions other than the

energy group SU(11) of the 10-dimensional space-times . For Life, there has to be a new organizing principle.
But it is unlikely that such organizing principles reside in matter emerging at the appropriate level of complexity
of the universe and the planets etc. where the situations of biological temperatures are available.
There is one more important question --the question of meaning. Computers process symbols but not
the meaning of symbols. The meaning exists in the mind of the programmer. Computer scientists routinely
assume such a psychophysical parallelism in their theories as discussed by Varela, Thomson, and Rosch, 1991,
and even by Dennett 2007. Similarly, the meaning of living functions and attributes such as maintenance,
reproduction, evolution, and form must be carried in a separate body within consciousness. This body is
traditionally called the "vital body. In summary, we need a theory of bio-physical parallelism --a simultaneous
and parallel functioning of a vital body and a physical body. But the introduction of the vital body (including
consciousness) in biology surely raises the spectre of dualism. It is the solution of the problem of dualism with
the help of quantum measurement theory that makes science within consciousness a viable concept for biology.
If there are two separate dual bodies, in two phases, what mediates their interaction and without violating
conservation laws such as the Conservation laws of Energy?—is the latent energy group SU(6) which mediates
the parallelism between the physical and the vital body by creating an electromagnetic wave propagations. And
maintains the exact correspondence, if the vital body exists in a parallel existence with the physical in exact
correspondence (biophysical parallelism as enunciated by Leibnitz), the problem of dualism still
larks.Evidence for the quantum nature of the vital body is found in the demonstration of non-locality. Qigong
masters can non-locally affect the vital field of plants enough to enhance or reduce the rate of biochemical
reactions involved in plant growth. Further note that the quantum picture enables us to think about the physical
and the vital worlds differently from what we are used to. Normally, we tend to think of both of these worlds as
made of substances (something "concrete"). Sure, the vital substance is more subtle.We cannot quantify it in the
same way as we can the physical. But it is still a substance, or so we think. We must change our view. Even the
physical is not substance in the ordinary sense, let alone the "vital". Both physical and vital worlds remain as
quantum superposition of possibilities until consciousness gives them substantiality by collapsing an actual
experience. The quantum system in the cell along with Macro-measurement apparatuses that amplify its states
(and also make a record of the actualized states upon measurement) --whose states are collapsed in a correlated
parallel fashion with the states of the vital body -- can be said to have mapped the blueprint, the meaning,
contained in the latter. This is similar to how we write software on computer hardware. The maps are inherited
by all the cells of the body of a multi-cellular organism through cell division. The shared maps can solve some
of the profound puzzles of biological morphogenesis.

Conclusion

Quantum physics indicates that consciousness is related to the awareness that an electron appears to
show in the wave/particle duality (double slit experiment). Quantum physicists have shown that the electron
behaves differently when being observed by a human. When the electron is not being observed, the electron
behaves like a wave, but when an observing instrument is placed in the experiment, the electron behaves like a
particle. This experience indicates that the electron will change its behaviour/reality depending on whether or
not the electron is being observed as if the electron is aware that it is being observed. This awareness is very
similar, if not the same, as human awareness and may be related to the same consciousness. Thus consciousness
understood if there creates lives otherwise it becomes pseudo but working silently for the formation of our
universes and then behaves like entanglement. Consciousness is, therefore, a non-material entity capable of
independent, eternal existence, and not a property but may be used as property. Consciousness is not emergent,
and is eternal similar to the electron. It can remain localized in the human brain and interact with the brain, and
thereby, control the activities of the human body. While electrons in the brain behave as particles, these
electrons prevent the consciousness from realizing that it is part of a larger whole. When the electrons behave as
a wave, the consciousness becomes aware of its existence outside the human mind, which makes OBE and NDE
possible. Whenever the electron wave function collapses, the OBE and NDE ends and the person returns to their
physical body and its perception of reality similar to the collapsing of the wave function in the double slit
experiment in quantum physics. During the OBE and NDE while the electron is behaving as a wave function,
consciousness can leave the brain and go into an independent floating existence outside the human body where
it can travel independent of space-time similar to the entangled electron.
It has been shown using such techniques as PET and MRI that the above process of receiving data from
a stimulus by a sensory organ, transmitting them to the brain, computing and processing the data, and passing
the processed data to consciousness, can be reversed by hypnotizing a person. When hypnotherapies suggests,
for example, that he/she is seeing red light to a hypnotized subject, all above processes take place in the brain as
if the subject is actually seeing red light. The consciousness gives the brain a perception of reality that is
different from the hypnotherapies‘ perception of reality similarly to an observer in the example of general
relativity where one observer on Earth watches another travel away at the speed of light. To the travelling

observer, his perception of reality is different than the observer watching from Earth, and as a result, his
experience of time is different than the observer on Earth.
The ability of a person to describe what his/her consciousness had observed or heard while it is in a
des-embodied state makes us to believe that memory is, at least partly, non-material and unaffected by
collapsing the wave function. Quantum systems are essentially unified, and so are our thought processes. David
Bohm says, ―Thought processes and quantum systems are analogous in that they cannot be analysed too much in
terms of distinct elements because the intrinsic nature of each element is not a property existing separately from
and independently of other elements, but is instead a property that arises partially from its relation with other
elements.‖We can conclude that consciousness is a quantum mechanical entity that can have an independent
existence but related with the matter substances as it explained that the bosons of the Gaussian energy group
SU(6) changes to the bosons of SU(5) or vice-versa. It can localize in the human brain when the electron is in a
particle state. This provides the necessary quantum mechanical base conductive for it to interact with and
function in the brain. When the state changes to that of a wave, consciousness takes flight and starts floating. It
takes away with it at least a part of the contents of the memory. It possesses the ability to acquire visual,
auditory and olfactory information in spite of the fact that there are no sense organs associated with it. This
information is produced by the consciousness projection of a different reality caused by the change in state of
the electron, which one may interpret later as a dream or hallucination that comes from an altered perception of
reality.
The major stumbling block in solving the brain-mind problem is how does the brain-mind bind
together millions of dissimilar neuron activities into an experience of a perceptual whole. How does the ―I‖ or
―self‖ or the perceived wholeness of one‘s world emerge from a system consisting of so many parts, billions of
neurons. What creates the ―Oneness‖ of thought processes? What creates individuality and ―I‖-ness or ―self‖?
What creates feelings, free will, and creativity? The problem is solved only by making a complete total body
assumed like an atom/molecule with the combination of two different characters of electro-magnetic wave
functions producing in two different phases by the symmetry breaking of SU(11) & SU(5) and then formation of
biological particles, otherwise does not create such feelings etc.
In classical science, the most ordered structure that we can find is the crystal. Crystals are rigid,
immovable structures. In Bose-Einstein condensates, the quantum properties allow both a ―fluid‖ order and a
high degree of unity. Each particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate produces and also fills all the spaces by the
strong force SU(6) and all the time in whatever container that holds the condensate. Many of their
characteristics are correlated. They behave holistically as one. The condensate acts as one single particle. There
is no ―noise‖ or interference between separate parts. This is why super fluids and super conductors have their
special frictionless qualities and lasers become so coherent. Super conductors, super fluids, and lasers are BoseEinstein condensates. The photons of a laser beam overlap their boundaries and behave as one single photon and
the whole system can be described by a single equation. Hence, the part always includes the whole like in fractal
geometry. Super conductors, super fluids, and lasers are either very low temperature or very high energy
systems. Super conductors and super fluids lose their quantum coherence long before they reach room
temperature. Quantum coherence at body temperature in body cells was found by Herbert Frohlich. Prior to that,
quantum physicist Fritz Popp discovered that biological tissue emits a weak glow when stimulated at the right
energy levels. Cell walls of biological tissue contain countless proteins and fat molecules which are electrical
dipoles. When a cell is at rest, these dipoles are out of phase and arrange themselves in a haphazard way. But
when they are stimulated they begin to oscillate or jiggle intensely and broadcast a tiny microwave signal.
Frolich found that when the energy flowing through the cell reaches a certain critical level, all the cell wall
molecular dipoles line up and come into phase. They oscillate in unison as though they are suddenly
coordinated. This emergent quantum field is a Bose-Einstein condensate and has holistic properties common to
any quantum field. Consciousness may work in a similar matter.
Zohar, 1990 suggests that ion channel oscillations in neurons are quantum phenomena; which, as in
Frolich systems, generates a coherent quantum electric field. It is a Bose-Einstein condensate. Existence of such
large scale coherent electrical fields across the brain explains how a large number of disparate and distant
neurons can integrate their information to produce a holistic picture, hologram. The quantum entanglement
proof that has been developed fairly recently says that non-local [instantaneous or faster than light that means
we consider photons of SU(6)] quantum correlations exists between particles apparently separated in space and
time has helped scientists to understand these effects, quantum entanglement, also called the quantum non-local
connection, is a property of a quantum mechanical state of a system of two or more objects in which the
quantum states of the constituting objects are linked together so that one object can no longer be adequately
described without full mention of its counterpart—even if the individual objects are spatially separated in a
space-like manner.
The crucial distinguishing feature of Bose-Einstein condensate is that many parts which go to make up
the ordered system not only behave as a whole, but they become whole. Their identities merge and overlap in

such a way that they lose their individuality entirely. This is a quantum property. Such a large quantum
synchronicity exists in and accounts for the special properties of lasers, super conductors, and super fluids. Only
this type of quantum correlated condensed state could explain the unbroken wholeness of the thought process.
Consciousness behaves as a fractal. This is similar to a hologram where small fractal parts are identical to the
whole part. The property of the brain which is the non-local quantum correlate or the Bose-Einstein condensate
behaves as above. It creates a unity from the diverse bits of information drawing them to a meaningful whole.
The millions of sensory data from sense organs received every moment are channelled to various disparate areas
of the brain and processed by the computing facility of the brain. Consciousness receives this processed
information and creates a holistic scene, hologram. It is this integration of all the processed bits of information
to create a one whole that creates the identity as a person, the self or the I-ness. Here is the coherent non-local
quantum correlation of the brain and it is an emergent property. Consciousness is a non-material entity in the
quantum domain that is capable of independent existence. Consciousness can remain localized in the brain so
long as the emergent quantum particle state does not change, just as an electron which is a quantum entity can
remain localized in an atom so long as the energy of the electron matches the quantum state it occupies.
Whenever the property breaks down, the mathematical function that governs the behaviour of quantum particles
changes, i.e. the electrons changes its behaviour from that of a particle to a wave function. When this happens in
the brain, consciousness can leave the brain and take up a floating existence in the way an electron leaves its
atom if it acquires excess energy and starts a floating existence as a free electron. Consciousness can return to
the brain if the property is re-established and the wave function collapses and the particle function prevails. This
model may explain all the observed properties of human consciousness including Psi-phenomena, NDE, OBE
and reincarnation. Thus we required balance energy for living otherwise death. Since all information transfer in
a non-local quantum correlation is instantaneous, just like the speed of an electron and light is instantaneous, it
explains the speed of human action. It can be extended to explain phenomena such as telepathy and also
explains the individual identity, or the I-ness or self. It is initially puzzling that the same type of experiments
that show a correlation between consciousness and individual neuron also show a correlation between the global
gamma synchrony and consciousness. So which of these produces consciousness, the individual neurons or the
gamma synchrony? Recent studies suggest that activity in individual neurons correlates with the gamma
synchrony when a number of the neuron‘s neighbours were also active. This agrees with studies showing ‗hot
spots‘ of activity in the brain also correlated with consciousness. Here we are perhaps left with the concept that
the brain is a gate to the fundamental level of the universe, in the literal sense of a mechanism that allows or
prevents entry. All of this may seem very speculative, but against this has to be set the lack of explanation in
classical physics for the ‗something it is like‘ or the ability to have choice or preference that we find in
consciousness. We need all the explanation by quantum physics which shows the appropriate way for solutions.
