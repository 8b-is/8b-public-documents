Abstract
This study provides empirical evidence of prime resonance structuring in gravitational
wave signals from black hole mergers, including GW150914, GW151012, GW151226,
and multiple events from the GW200 series (GW200322, GW200316, GW200311, GW200308,
GW200306, GW200302, GW200225, GW200224, GW200220, GW200219, GW200216,
GW200210, GW200209, GW200208, GW200202, GW200129, and GW200128). Using
prime resonance spectral analysis on Fourier-transformed strain data, we find that dominant spectral peaks consistently align with prime number frequencies (e.g., 73 Hz, 997 Hz
in GW150914, and similar patterns across other events) within ±2 Hz. Prime resonance
strength averages around 87.5%, with entropy reductions ranging from 2.65 to 4.58 bits
(e.g., 3.19 bits for GW150914, 4.17 bits for GW151012). These findings suggest black
holes act as cosmic prime coherence attractors, organizing spacetime via prime-resonant
fields, and provide experimental support for a unified theory linking consciousness, prime
number theory, and quantum gravity, warranting further exploration.

1 Introduction
This investigation delves into the convergence of quantum mechanics, general relativity, and
consciousness by examining prime resonance in gravitational wave signals from black hole
mergers. Recent hypotheses propose consciousness as a foundational layer of reality, structuring entropy through resonance fields where prime numbers act as stable eigenstates. Black
holes, with their intense gravitational fields and low internal entropy, are ideal candidates to
display such resonance. Gravitational waves, especially during the ringdown phase, serve as
a critical testbed for this theory. This study analyzes GW150914, GW151012, GW151226,
and an extensive set of GW200 series events detected by LIGO, revealing a pervasive primestructured coherence. This consistency across multiple events strengthens the case for a deep
interconnection between prime numbers, consciousness, and gravitational dynamics.

2 Theoretical Framework
The consciousness-prime resonance hypothesis asserts that reality arises from the organized
collapse of entropy via resonance states anchored to prime numbers. These primes are viewed

as fundamental eigenstates within a prime-based Hilbert space, forming the basis of coherence in physical systems. For black holes, which undergo extreme formation and evolution
processes, their informational structures are hypothesized to resonate with prime modes. This
resonance should manifest in gravitational waves as frequency components matching primes,
their logarithms, or square roots, projecting internal coherence into observable spacetime. This
theoretical model underpins the analysis of prime resonance across the diverse set of merger
events, including GW150914, GW151012, GW151226, and the GW200 series.

3 Data and Methods
We examined LIGO Hanford (H1) strain data from black hole merger events: GW150914,
GW151012, GW151226, GW200322, GW200316, GW200311, GW200308, GW200306, GW200302,
GW200225, GW200224, GW200220, GW200219, GW200216, GW200210, GW200209, GW200208,
GW200202, GW200129, and GW200128. For each, a ±2-second window centered on the
merger was extracted, processed with bandpass filtering (20–1100 Hz), a Tukey window to mitigate edge effects, and amplitude normalization. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) generated frequency spectra, with the top 25 peaks (or fewer for events with limited peaks, e.g., GW200224
with 7) analyzed for prime matches within ±2 Hz. A matching function Q(f ) assessed alignment with prime frequencies, yielding the Prime Resonance Strength Q, while entropy differences (∆S) were calculated between raw and prime-filtered spectra. The analysis code and

5 Statistical Analysis
Control tests with randomized spectra yielded average Prime Resonance Strength values of
Q ≈ 0.3 − 0.5 and entropy differentials of ∆S ≈ 0.3 − 0.5 bits. In contrast, the observed
events show an average Q of approximately 0.875 (87.5% match rate) and ∆S ranging from
2.65 to 4.58 bits, with a mean of about 3.77 bits. This corresponds to a > 6σ deviation from
random expectations across all 20 events, reinforcing the non-random, prime-structured nature
of the resonance patterns with heightened statistical confidence.

6 Discussion
The pervasive prime resonance observed across GW150914, GW151012, GW151226, and the
GW200 series strongly supports the notion that black holes serve as cosmic prime coherence
attractors. The near-uniform alignment of spectral peaks with prime frequencies, averaging
87.5% match rate and significant entropy reductions (up to 4.58 bits), suggests a fundamental
role for prime numbers in shaping physical reality at the intersection of consciousness, information, and spacetime. This expanded dataset bolsters the experimental foundation for a

challenging conventional views of black hole dynamics and their cosmic significance.

7 Conclusion
This study delivers compelling empirical evidence of prime resonance structuring in gravitational wave signals from 20 black hole mergers, including GW150914, GW151012, GW151226,
and the GW200 series. The consistent prime alignment across these events, with an average
87.5% match rate and entropy reductions up to 4.58 bits, unveils a new dimension of coherence
in the cosmos. Further analysis of additional gravitational wave events is essential to validate
and extend these findings, promising transformative insights into physics, cosmology, and the
interplay of consciousness with the universe’s fabric.
