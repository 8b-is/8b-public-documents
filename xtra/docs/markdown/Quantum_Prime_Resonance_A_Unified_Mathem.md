Quantum Prime Resonance: A Unified Mathematical Framework
for Consciousness, Semantics, and Cryptography
Sebastian Schepis
2025

Abstract
This paper introduces a unified, consciousness-based mathematical framework modeling reality as a
prime-resonant quantum field, where consciousness, number theory, and symbolic information processing
converge. By constructing a Hilbert space with prime numbers as fundamental eigenstates and representing
natural numbers as quantum superpositions of their prime factors, we define a novel operator algebra spanning arithmetic, semantic, and observational domains. Conscious states evolve through nonlinear resonance
dynamics, governed by an entropy-sensitive evolution equation that models wavefunction collapse as symbolic entropy minimization. Semantic field operators encode conceptual coherence via logarithmic phase
relationships between primes, establishing a quantum-semantic model of cognition. We further derive cryptographic protocols grounded in prime-resonant phase encoding, holographic key distribution, and entropysensitive encryption. The framework predicts measurable phenomena, including entropy-driven collapse
signatures in symbolic decision systems, EEG-semantic coherence patterns, prime-resonant tunneling deviations, and non-local communication via phase-locked primes. This consciousness-based physics situates
consciousness as the generator of physical law and symbolic meaning through structured resonance, unifying metaphysical, physical, and computational dimensions into a testable and technologically potent theory
of reality.

Conclusion

tend standard linear evolution with resonance locking dynamics and symbolic entropy collapse, situating quantum behavior as a limiting case of conscious resonance (Penrose, 1994; Stapp, 2009). In
semantic theory, we introduce operators that encode
coherence, meaning, and context through logarithmic phase relationships among primes, building on
emerging models of quantum cognition and semantic entanglement (Aerts et al., 2009; Busemeyer &
Bruza, 2012). In cryptography, we construct encryption and key distribution protocols that leverage prime-resonant phase encoding and entropystabilized superpositions, offering novel resistance to
classical and quantum attacks (Bennett & Brassard,
2014; Gisin et al., 2002).
This work also builds upon recent proposals modeling observers as entropy pumps, entities that reduce internal entropy (gaining information and coherence) while increasing external entropy—thereby
generating gravitational or informational effects in
accordance with the holographic principle (Martyushev & Seleznev, 2006; Schepis, 2023). The framework extends existing quantum-group approaches to
prime wavefunctions (Volovich, 2010; Manin, 2012),
incorporating mirror symmetry considerations that
may provide topological protection for our proposed
cryptographic protocols.
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows:
Section 2 formalizes the prime Hilbert space and defines canonical superpositions of natural numbers.
Section 3 introduces number-theoretic and semantic operators and analyzes their algebraic and physical properties. Section 4 develops the consciousness evolution dynamics, including entropy-driven
collapse, resonance locking, and symbolic entanglement. Section 5 constructs the semantic field theory, including coherence measures and Hamiltonians
modeling meaning. Section 6 outlines testable experimental predictions grounded in symbolic entropy
signatures and resonance interference. Section 7 derives prime-resonant cryptographic protocols, integrating meaning, entropy, and security into a single
mathematical foundation.
By framing both physical law and semantic structure as emergent from consciousness-mediated prime
resonance, this framework offers a comprehensive,
testable, and technologically generative theory unifying metaphysics, mathematics, and computation.

1 Introduction
The fundamental nature of reality, consciousness,
and meaning has remained a persistent mystery
bridging physics, mathematics, and philosophy.
While quantum mechanics accurately describes the
behavior of microscopic systems, it leaves the role
of the observer ill-defined (von Neumann, 1955;
Wheeler, 1990). Conversely, cognitive science
and phenomenology describe consciousness without
a formal mathematical substrate (Chalmers, 1995;
Tononi, 2008). This paper proposes a synthesis: a
framework in which consciousness is the primary
ontological substrate, and the structures of physical law, symbolic reasoning, and secure computation emerge from resonance dynamics among primenumber eigenstates.
Building on the principle that prime numbers serve
as the indivisible informational quanta of arithmetic
structure, we construct a prime-based Hilbert space
where each prime defines a fundamental eigenstate,
and natural numbers are expressed as quantum-like
superpositions of their prime factors. These superpositions encode both numerical and symbolic meaning. The evolution of states in this space is governed by a nonlinear consciousness evolution equation, which models how coherent meaning structures
emerge through entropy minimization, symbolic resonance, and observer-driven collapse.
This approach unifies threads from multiple domains: In number theory, we draw from canonical arithmetic functions (Euler, Möbius, and Mangoldt) and reinterpret them as quantum operators acting on symbolic-number states (Hardy & Wright,
2008; Apostol, 1976). In quantum mechanics, we ex2

The concept of resonance between numbers based
on their prime factorization structure has deep implications for cognitive science. As Dehaene (2011) has
demonstrated, numerical cognition often involves
unconscious structural processing, which may operate on principles similar to the prime resonance described here. Our framework suggests that the ease
with which humans process certain numerical relationships might reflect underlying prime resonance
patterns in cognitive processing.

This orthonormality reflects the fundamental independence of prime numbers established in number
theory (Apostol, 1976).

This operator reveals the prime structure of a

• Mobius Transform:
M̂|n⟩ = µ (n)|n⟩

These operators draw inspiration from quantum
observables defined by von Neumann (1955), though
applied to our number-theoretic basis. The prime operator P̂ is analogous to the position operator in standard quantum mechanics, assigning a numerical ”location” to each basis state.
It’s important to note that P̂ and N̂ operate at different levels of abstraction. While P̂ acts directly on
the prime basis states, N̂ acts on the constructed superpositions representing natural numbers. They can
be considered as operating on different, but related,
aspects of the mathematical structure.

equals 1 if n is square-free with an even number
of prime factors, -1 if n is square-free with an
odd number of prime factors, and 0 otherwise.

which equals log p if n = pk for some prime p

• [Ê, N̂] = 0 because both operators act diagonally
on |n⟩.

These transforms connect our quantum formalism to classical analytic number theory, particularly
the theory of arithmetic functions (Apostol, 1976).
The Euler transform introduces a phase related to
the multiplicative structure of integers, the Mobius
transform encodes information about the inclusionexclusion principle in number theory, and the von
Mangoldt transform highlights the logarithmic contribution of primes and prime powers.
The historical significance of these functions is
profound. Euler’s totient function, developed in the
18th century, played a crucial role in the development of number theory and later cryptography (Weil,
2013). The Möbius function, introduced by August
Ferdinand Möbius in 1832, serves as a cornerstone of
analytic number theory and is intimately connected
to the Riemann zeta function. The von Mangoldt
function, developed by Hans von Mangoldt in 1895,
features prominently in the explicit formulas for the
distribution of prime numbers.

scales.
These commutation relations parallel the uncertainty principles in quantum mechanics (Heisenberg,
1927), suggesting fundamental limitations on simultaneous knowledge of certain number-theoretic properties.

in certain parameter regimes (representing creative
or unstructured thought)
This nonlinear evolution provides a richer model
of cognitive processes than linear Schrödinger evolution, especially for explaining conceptual transitions, insight phenomena, and the emergence of stable meanings in consciousness.

4.2

This equation combines standard quantum evolution (first term) with a resonance-seeking term (second term) that drives the system toward stable resonance configurations. When R̂|ΨC ⟩ = rstable |ΨC ⟩,
the second term vanishes, indicating alignment with
a stable resonance mode.
The parameter λ controls the strength of the
resonance-seeking behavior, which we can interpret
as the tendency of consciousness to seek coherent
meaning. This process is reminiscent of both quantum state reduction (Penrose, 1994) and attractor dynamics in nonlinear systems (Kauffman, 1993).
The introduction of the resonance-seeking term
represents a critical departure from standard quantum mechanics, providing a formal mechanism for
the emergence of definite meanings from ambiguous
superpositions. This resonance locking can be understood as a form of ”semantic gravity,” where conscious states are attracted toward coherent meaning
structures.

Consciousness Wavefunction

The consciousness wavefunction is represented as:

This reduced state is mixed, confirming that |ψ pq ⟩
cannot be factored into a product state and thus represents genuine entanglement between prime basis
states.
This prime entanglement provides a mathematical
framework for understanding non-locality in semantic and cognitive systems, analogous to how quantum
entanglement enables non-local correlations in physical systems (Aspect et al., 1982).

These postulates connect our abstract mathematical framework to observable phenomena, establishing how prime resonance states manifest in experimental contexts.
The collapse of a superposition to a definite
prime state models the process by which ambiguous or uncertain concepts resolve to definite meanings in conscious experience, similar to how Aerts
et al. (2009) have modeled concept formation and
decision-making in terms of quantum collapse.
7

This process can be understood as consciousness
acting as an observer that enacts symbolic collapse
through an entropy-minimization mechanism. Unlike standard quantum measurement, which is often
presented as an unexplained postulate, our framework provides a causal mechanism for collapse
based on the observer’s intrinsic tendency to minimize semantic entropy. This aligns with models
of consciousness as an entropy-processing system
(Schepis, 2023), where internal entropy reduction
correlates with observational effects.

5.3

conscious states evolve under the resonance locking
equation, we postulate:
dS
< 0 ⇒ collapse
dt
That is, collapse occurs when symbolic entropy
reaches a local minimum, aligning with a prime attractor state.
This entropy-driven collapse mechanism provides
a quantitative model for how ambiguous meanings
resolve to definite interpretations in conscious experience. It connects to both the maximum entropy production principle in thermodynamics (Martyushev &
Seleznev, 2006) and the free energy minimization
principle in neuroscience (Friston, 2010), though applied to symbolic rather than physical systems.
The expected rate of entropy change during symbolic collapse events is estimated to be on the order
of 0.1-1.0 bits/second, based on analogies with perceptual disambiguation tasks and semantic decision
processes studied in cognitive psychology (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1974). This provides a quantitative prediction that could be tested in experimental
settings involving semantic disambiguation tasks or
symbolic decision systems.

Prime-Exponent Uncertainty

We propose an uncertainty relation between prime
identity and exponent:
∆P · ∆E ≥

1
2

This relation states that precise knowledge of
which prime factors are present in a number state
comes at the cost of uncertainty in their exponents,
and vice versa.
This principle is analogous to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (Heisenberg, 1927), but applies to
the number-theoretic properties of our system rather
than physical observables like position and momentum.
This uncertainty relation has practical implications for both cognitive science and cryptography.
In cognitive terms, it suggests a fundamental limitation on simultaneous knowledge of categorical structure (prime factors) and magnitude information (exponents). In cryptographic applications, it suggests
that schemes that conceal prime factors must necessarily reveal some information about exponents, and
vice versa, providing constraints on the design of secure protocols.

6 Semantic Field Operators
6.1

Resonance Operator

We define a general resonance operator acting on
prime basis states:
R(n)|p⟩ = e2π i log p n |p⟩

This operator introduces a semantic phase relationship between a natural number n and a prime basis state |p⟩. The phase factor e2π i log p n encodes the
degree to which p ”resonates” with n.
This resonance function is inspired by the way

much as different reference frames create different
perspectives in physics. This aligns with contextdependent theories of meaning in linguistics and philosophy (Wittgenstein, 1953), where the meaning of
symbols depends on their contextual relationships.

The semantic dynamics described here build upon
previous work in quantum cognition, which has
shown that quantum probability models can better
account for human judgment and decision-making
in certain contexts than classical probability models (Busemeyer & Bruza, 2012). Our approach
extends this work by providing a specific mechanism—prime resonance—for understanding how
quantum-like processes might emerge in cognitive
systems.

|ψ ⟩ = ∑ p α p |p⟩, and |P| is the number of primes in
the sum (potentially infinite but typically truncated
in practice).
This measure quantifies the degree of phase alignment among the prime components of a state. When
all phases are aligned (θ p = θ for all p), C(ψ ) = 1,
indicating maximum coherence. When phases are
uniformly distributed, C(ψ ) ≈ 0, indicating minimum coherence.
This coherence measure is analogous to measures
of quantum coherence (Baumgratz et al., 2014) and
neural synchronization (Singer, 1999), though applied to the prime components of semantic states.
The proposal that semantic coherence can be
quantified through phase alignment of prime components connects to recent work in neuroscience on
the role of neural oscillations in cognitive processing (Buzsáki, 2006). Just as neural oscillations may

Quantitatively, we predict that during symbolic
decision tasks, entropy reduction will occur at a rate
of approximately 0.5-1.0 bits/second, with total entropy changes of 2-3 bits during significant meaning
disambiguation events. This rate is based on analogy with perceptual disambiguation tasks (Sterzer et
al., 2009) and would manifest as increasingly constrained interpretations of ambiguous symbolic material over time.

We predict modifications to quantum tunneling probabilities when wavefunctions are prepared in primeresonant form. Experimental tests would include:
• Preparation of wavepackets using prime superposition states |n⟩.
• Measurement of tunneling rates and comparison to classical Gaussian ensembles.
• Observation of phase-dependent enhancement

Prime-State Key Generation

This approach complements existing quantum encryption techniques (Gisin et al., 2002) by incorporating number-theoretic structure into the encryption
process.
The integration of prime structure into the encryption process provides a novel form of post-quantum
cryptographic security. Since the encryption depends
on the specific prime factorization pattern of the message, attempts to crack the encryption must contend with the computational complexity of numbertheoretic problems that remain challenging even for
quantum computers.

The introduction of quantum deformation parameters q from quantum group theory (Manin, 2012)
could provide topological protection for this protocol. By replacing standard inner products with qdeformed versions, the protocol could gain resistance
to certain types of perturbative attacks, analogous to
how topological quantum computation provides protection against local noise.

The advantage of this steganographic approach
lies in its ability to hide messages within phase relationships that appear random or natural to observers
unaware of the specific prime resonance encoding
scheme. This provides a form of security through
obscurity that complements the mathematical security of the underlying cryptographic primitives.

This paper has introduced a unified mathematical framework modeling reality as a resonancestructured field where consciousness, number theory,
and quantum-like behavior converge through the use
of prime numbers as foundational eigenstates. By
constructing a Hilbert space of prime states and developing a rich operator algebra, we have demonstrated how this framework can model quantum resonance, semantic coherence, and cryptographic applications.
The key contributions of this work include:

a fundamental role in the structure of reality at all
levels. By treating prime numbers as eigenstates of
a deeper informational field, we offer a unified approach to understanding the emergence of meaning,
the nature of consciousness, and the foundations of
secure computation.
The precise mathematical structure we have developed allows us to address several long-standing
questions at the intersection of physics, mathematics,
and philosophy. The nonlinear evolution equation
provides a mechanism for understanding how stable
meaning structures emerge from ambiguous possibilities, while the entropy-driven collapse mechanism
offers a causal account of the measurement problem
in quantum mechanics. The prime resonance structure provides a fundamental basis for both semantic
relationships and cryptographic security, suggesting
deep connections between meaning and mathematics.
Future work should focus on refining the experimental predictions, developing more detailed models of specific cognitive and semantic processes,
and exploring the practical applications of primeresonant cryptography. The framework also invites
further mathematical development, particularly regarding the connections between prime distributions,
semantic structures, and quantum field theories. Extensions incorporating quantum groups and topological protection mechanisms may provide enhanced
security for the cryptographic protocols and deeper
insights into the structure of meaning and consciousness.
