Abstract
Consciousness and reality are related through the “measurement problem” in quantum mechanics, i.e., why we do not consciously
perceive particles as quantum superpositions of multiple possibilities, as they appear to be when unobserved, but rather perceive them
consciously as being in definite states or locations. Quantum pioneers Niels Bohr, John von Neumann, Eugene Wigner, and Henry
Stapp concluded that subjective conscious observation causes quantum state reduction (“subjective reduction” (SR)), that “consciousness collapses the wavefunction.” However, Sir Roger Penrose suggested instead that quantum state reduction occurs spontaneously
due to an objective threshold property (“objective reduction” (OR)) in fundamental spacetime geometry, collapsing the wave function
and causing moments of conscious experience (“collapse causes consciousness,” or “collapse is consciousness”). Penrose OR would
be occurring ubiquitously and randomly in the environment (“decoherence”) resulting in ubiquitous proto-conscious moments. The
Penrose–Hameroff “Orch OR” model of orchestrated objective reduction suggests that microtubules inside brain neurons “orchestrate”
quantum computations which “halt” by Orch OR to produce moments of a full, rich conscious experience.

Introduction—Consciousness and Reality
The nature of reality, its conscious observation, and the relation between the two continue to perplex modern science and
philosophy. A key issue is exemplified by the “measurement
problem” in quantum mechanics.
The measurement problem concerns the appearance of a
world divided into two realms: (1) a material, macroscopic
“classical” realm in which particles occupy specific locations
and states, and (2) an immaterial, microscopic “quantum”
realm in which wave-like particles occupy multiple possible
states or locations simultaneously (“superposition”—evolving
and described by the unitary Schrödinger equation). Quantum
particles may be inter-connected over distance (“entanglement”) and condensed into unitary entities (“coherence”).
However, what we perceive through conscious observation, either directly or by examining results in a machine, is
invariably classical. We see “things” as basically separate, in

definite states and distinct locations at any one time, not as
wave-like superpositions of multiple possibilities. Early quantum pioneers including Niels Bohr deduced quantum superposition of particles, but found that the very act of subjectively
measuring, or of consciously observing them, seemed to select
a particular state or location among their various possibilities.
It appeared that the act of measurement, or conscious observation, caused the wavefunction to “collapse” to definite states
(“quantum state reduction”). Consciousness was said to cause
“collapse of the wavefunction.”
This approach was dubbed the “Copenhagen interpretation”
(after Bohr’s Danish origin), and held by John von Neumann,
Eugene Wigner (1961) and, more recently, Henry Stapp (1993,
2007), to whom this book and chapter are dedicated. For Bohr
et al., “Copenhagen” was a pragmatic solution allowing quantum experiments to continue, leading to major advances in
many areas of science and technology. But, Copenhagen was
conceptually problematic, leading to more unanswered questions. How large could superpositions become? What of reality
without conscious observers? Questioning Copenhagen,
Einstein famously asked: “Is the moon not there if no-one is
looking?” And, Erwin Schrödinger designed his famous
thought experiment about linking and amplifying a microscopic
quantum superposition to the fate of a cat.

32

Schrödinger imagined that a quantum superposition of two
states, such as the simultaneous passage and reflection of a
photon through/from a half-silvered mirror, could be connected to something macroscopic. For example, if the photon is
reflected, it would enter a box containing a cat and open a vial
of poison which would kill the cat. If the photon passes
through the mirror, it continues harmlessly and the cat remains
alive. Because there was no apparent limit to amplification of
superpositions, Copenhagen asserted the photon both passing
through, and not passing the mirror would both enter the box
to kill the cat, and not enter. According to Copenhagen,
Schrödinger reasoned, the cat would be in superposition of
both dead and alive until the box was opened, and the cat
observed by a conscious human.
Schrödinger intended his thought experiment to be a “burlesque example” of both amplification of superposition, and
consequences of the Copenhagen interpretation, namely that
consciousness collapses the wavefunction, that subjective experience caused quantum state reduction (“subjective reduction” (SR)). The obvious absurdity was intended to disparage
Copenhagen, but nearly a century later, the questions persist.
How large can superpositions become, how long can they
persist, and why do not we see them in our perceived world?
The SR/Copenhagen approach also put consciousness outside of science, as a mysterious entity resolving the measurement problem, but without any explanation of its nature, how
or why it could cause collapse/quantum state reduction. In
attempting to understand consciousness, SR/Copenhagen
was a dualist, but plausible position. For example, Stapp
(1993, 2007) views consciousness as a “cosmic mind,” a universal subjective awareness causing collapse, and influencing
the choice of selected outcomes.
Alternative, additional explanations for the measurement
problem have developed over the years. In the 1950s, Hugh
Everett (1955) suggested that superpositions persist, and do
not collapse/undergo state reduction. Rather, he suggested,
each possibility in a superposition evolves to form its own
universe, that there exists an infinity of “multiple worlds,” or
“parallel universes.” This so-called multiple worlds interpretation is quite popular among physicists, despite being untestable, and (to many at least) illogical and absurd. But, it avoids
collapse, and any need for consciousness.
Another approach is “decoherence,” the notion that quantum superpositions which come into contact with their “environment” lose their quantum properties. However, the microscopic environment is also quantum in nature, composed of
superpositioned particles, and quantum states thus seem likely
to spread and evolve rather than terminate. Decoherence does
not solve the measurement problem.
There are also approaches proposing an objective threshold
for quantum state reduction, known as “objective reduction,”
or “OR” theories. For example, Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber
(“GRW” Ghirardi et al. 1986) suggested that a critical number

Act Nerv Super (2019) 61:31–40

of superpositioned entangled particles (~ 1012) will selfcollapse to classical states, undergo objective reduction
(OR). But, GRW does not specify the level at which particles
should be considered, e.g., molecular, atomic, or sub-atomic
levels, nor explain why collapse would occur nor account for
consciousness.

Penrose OR
In his 1989 book The emperor’s new mind, Sir Roger Penrose
(1989) suggested a different type of objective reduction to
solve the measurement problem, and in so doing put forth a
scientific basis for consciousness. He began by addressing the
nature of superposition through Einstein’s general relativity in
which mass is equivalent to curvature in spacetime geometry,
previously considered for large masses, like the sun bending
light from distant stars (a prediction proven by Eddington in
1919. Penrose (1989, 1996) applied the same principle to
quantum particles, considering them as tiny curvatures in
spacetime geometry (refs).
What is spacetime geometry? Since the time of ancient
Greece until Eddington’s verification of Einstein’s general relativity in 1919, a debate persisted on whether the universe was
an empty void in which matter resided, or if it consisted of
some type of background “plenum” with intrinsic geometry,
with matter somehow embedded as particular configurations
or curvature of that background.
What is the background? What is it that curves? The precise
nature of spacetime geometry, e.g., at the infinitesimal Planck
scale, is unknown, but has been described in terms of spin networks, twistors, quantum foam, etc. (Penrose, 2004). Without
specifying the precise geometry or makeup, Penrose illustrated a
4-dimensional spacetime geometry (three spatial and one temporal dimensions) as 2-dimensional spacetime ‘sheets,’ with one
dimension of space, and one dimension of time (Fig. 1).
In this approach, particle location corresponds with a specific curvature in these 2-dimensional spacetime sheets, and a
particle oscillating between locations is equivalent to oscillation in spacetime curvature (Fig. 1, left). Penrose then characterized particle superposition as alternate curvatures in
spacetime geometry (Fig. 1, right). Each possible particle location has its own tiny region of spacetime geometry, and one
might imagine that were such separated curvatures to continue, that “multiple worlds” would result (Fig. 2).
If collapse occurs as in Copenhagen, and Stapp’s view,
conscious observation will cause one curvature/particle location to cease to exist, and the other to continue (Fig. 3, top;
SR). In this, and other figures, BING is used to denote conscious, subjective experience, i.e., “consciousness.”
However, Roger Penrose suggested spacetime separations
would be unstable, and self-collapse (undergo quantum state
reduction) to single spacetime curvatures at a critical objective

threshold (OR), along the lines of GRW, in which an objective
threshold caused reduction. However, unlike GRW, in which
the OR threshold was related to the number of entangled
superpositioned particles, Penrose OR was tied to a property
of the particles’ equivalent spacetime geometry curvature,
namely, the “gravitational self-energy” EG involved in separating mass, or its equivalent spacetime, from itself. Roger
predicted OR would occur at an average time t given by t =
h/EG (related to the uncertainty principle, where h is the
Planck–Dirac constant, and EG is the gravitational selfenergy of the separation (Hameroff and Penrose 1996a,

1996b)). The inverse relation between EG (the magnitude of
the superposition) and time t means that large superpositions
(large EG) will quickly reach OR threshold (small t), while
small superpositions (small EG) will require a long time (large
t) to reach threshold.
In The emperor’s new mind, Penrose (1989) further argued
from Goedel’s theorem that conscious understanding required
some feature outside the brain’s classical computational system, or any classical computer. What consciousness required,
he argued, was something “non-computable” outside classical
physics, leading to quantum mechanics, and the measurement
problem. Roger suggested that OR, outside classical physics,
was the logical source of consciousness, that each OR event
was a “conscious now,” a moment of experiential awareness
(denoted here by BING). Rather than consciousness causing
collapse (Copenhagen, SR) Penrose OR proposes just the opposite, that collapse causes consciousness (or is equivalent to
consciousness), and that OR and consciousness occur spontaneously due to a fundamental property of spacetime geometry.
If so, OR events would be occurring ubiquitously in a general microscopic environment in which quantum superpositions will encounter more quantum superpositions and inevitably reach OR threshold for self-collapse. Because of the
random nature of the general environment, such OR events
might be accompanied only by random, disconnected moments of experiential awareness, deemed “proto-conscious.”
From a philosophical perspective, Penrose OR is similar to
the process approach of A.N. Whitehead (1929, 1933) who

which separates into their own universes, i.e., the “multiple worlds”
hypothesis

reduction (SR) quantum superposition of a particle in two locations in a

(denoted by “BING”) causes quantum state reduction or collapses of
the wavefunction at time t. One curvature ceases to exist, and the
alternative curvature/mass location exists in the material world.
Consciousness causes collapse. Bottom: objective reduction. Quantum

superposition of a particle in two locations in a 2-dimensional
spacetime sheet reaches threshold for Penrose OR at time t = h/EG at
which OR occurs with a moment of (proto-)conscious experience
(BING). Collapse causes (or is equivalent to) consciousness. Quantum
state reduction occurs due to an objective threshold (objective reduction).
An external conscious observer is not necessary, and “multiple worlds” is
avoided

described “occasions of experience” as discrete moments of
minimal consciousness occurring in a “wider field of protoconscious experience.” Both Whitehead and Penrose OR describe consciousness as sequences of discrete events, but face
the question of combining proto-conscious moments into a
full, rich conscious experience.
A similar que stion i s fa ced by p ropo nen t s of
“panpsychism,” in which proto-conscious experience is seen
as a ubiquitous property of matter. Panpsychism has been
embraced by well-known neuroscientists including Koch

(2012) and Giulio Tononi (2012), and faces several issues,
for example, the “combination problem” of how a multitude
of localized and disconnected mental states can combine in the
brain into full, rich consciousness. Another issue for
panpsychism is the level of material organization at which
subjective experience is to be expected—molecules, atoms,
and/or sub-atomic particles? On the other hand, Penrose OR
is not a property of matter, but an event by which particular
states of matter may be selected, and moments of
(proto-)consciousness occur.

Act Nerv Super (2019) 61:31–40

How could proto-conscious events “combine” in meaningful ways into a full, rich conscious experience? Quantum entanglement and coherence are obvious answers, unifying components and events into common entities. In entangled pairs,
and within a Bose–Einstein condensate, perturbing one component causes others to respond (as if they were “feeling”
perturbation of their cohort). And, entanglement among multiple superpositioned components would enable OR to occur
far more quickly, at time t = h/EG, where EG is the larger
gravitational self-energy of multiple superpositioned masses
“separated from themselves.” So, a group of entangled
superpositioned particles would have a larger EG and reach
threshold at a time t far sooner than individual particles if they
were not entangled. This helps avoid environmental interactions and could enable quantum computation.
Quantum entanglement may be required in neuroscience,
for example, to solve the “binding problem.” When a visual
object is perceived, its shape, color, motion, and meaning are
processed in different regions of visual cortex, and at slightly
different times. Yet, we do not see sequences of, for example,
diamond-shaped, red, fluttering,…, kite. We see a red kite
fluttering in the wind; its components unified (“bound”) into
a coherent conscious scene, perhaps by quantum
entanglement.
Quantum computers can process information as entangled
superpositions, i.e., quantum bits, or qubits of both 1 and 0
which then collapse, or reduce to definite states (1 or 0) as the
solution. In technological quantum computers, superpositioned
qubits interact by entanglement and evolve according to the
Schrödinger equation until they are “measured,” or interrupted,
such that each qubit reduces/collapses to a particular bit state as
the solution. The measurement process may introduce some
randomness.
However, a quantum computer whose entangled qubits
evolve to reach threshold for OR at time t = h/EG would, according to the Penrose OR proposal, have moments of (proto)conscious experience. Each OR moment would have an experiential aspect and select particular material states from
among alternative possibilities. Such selections may not involve randomness, as external measurement is thought to do,
but be influenced by what Penrose terms “Platonic values”
embedded in spacetime geometry.
Penrose OR was (and remains) the only specific scientific
mechanism for conscious mental states yet proposed. It also
resolves the measurement problem in quantum mechanics and
conceptually reconciles quantum mechanics and general relativity. But to explain consciousness in the brain, Roger needed
some type of biological quantum computer which could (1)
logically process quantum information superpositions in an organized, or “orchestrated” way; (2) entangle, resonate, and
evolve to reach threshold at time t = h/EG when the quantum
computation would halt or terminate by objective reduction
(OR); and (3) interface/regulate neuronal and synaptic functions.

Microtubules and “Orch OR”
By the time I read Roger’s book The emperor’s new mind in the
early 1990s, I had for 20 years been studying information processing capabilities of microtubules, cylindrical lattice polymers of the protein tubulin, and major components of the cytoskeleton inside neurons and other cells. Microtubules communicate with and regulate neuronal membrane and synaptic activities and appear to function as a deeper layer of information
processing in a dynamical brain hierarchy which extends downward, and inward, inside neurons. With physics colleagues
(e.g., Smith et al. 1984; Rasmussen et al. 1990), we applied
the quantum concept of “Fröhlich coherence” as a clocking
mechanism for microtubule information processing. Herbert
Fröhlich (1968, 1970, 1975) had proposed a unitary quantum
state of “optical phonons” among geometrically constrained
proteins, originating in non-polar intra-protein regions of pi
electron resonance clouds, precisely where (it was later discovered) anesthetic gases act to selectively erase consciousness. I
had concluded that microtubules could organize, or “orchestrate” information at a very fine scale in biology to act as each
cell’s nervous system or “on-board computer.” I suggested to
Roger that microtubules may be the quantum computer he
needed to organize, or orchestrate OR events in the brain to
result in consciousness. After some inspection, he agreed that
microtubules were viable candidates, and we proceeded to form
a theoretical model for consciousness consistent with Penrose
physics and known neurobiology.
The basic idea was that microtubules inside brain neurons
would function as biological quantum computers, exchanging
information with neural- and network-level activities like
membrane potentials and synaptic plasticity. Their entangled
qubits would evolve in an orchestrated fashion to reach threshold for OR at time t = h/EG, and have moments of conscious
experience. Thus, entangled microtubules would alternate between (1) orchestrated quantum evolution (qubits) isolated
from the environment, terminating by Orch OR, and (2) classical states exchanging input and output with neuronal-level
processes and the external world.
What are the qubits? Initially, we suggested that alternative
states of individual tubulins could become superpositioned as a
tubulin qubit with binary states. But based on biological evidence, the Orch OR qubit has evolved to polarity orientations of
collective electron cloud dipole (or spin) states within tubulins
(Figs. 4 and 5). These dipoles within tubulins are proposed to
couple to those in neighboring tubulins along helical pathways
in microtubule lattices, e.g., following Fibonacci geometry in
A-lattice microtubules. The polarity orientations oscillate, and
can exist in superposition of both orientations, with an appropriate EG which evolves to reach Orch OR threshold at time t by
t = h/EG. This pathway qubit is conceptually similar to topological qubits (e.g. Dennis and Preskill 2002) which are quite stable versus decoherence (or premature OR).

Electrons have a very low mass, and thus EG (= h/t) based on
electron cloud dipoles or spin would be very small, requiring a
very long time t. However, electron movements and superpositions induce movement and superposition of their atomic nuclei
by charge and the Mossbauer effect (Sataric et al. 1998). Nuclei
have much larger mass than electrons and EG so that threshold
for OR (and Orch OR) can be reached at a reasonably brief time
t if they are entangled in a common EG. The Mossbauer effect
predicts a 1 nanometer (nm) movement of an electron that
would move its nucleus (e.g., for carbon) 1 femtometer (fm),
i.e., the diameter of the nucleus, and sufficient separation for EG
to be generated (Hameroff and Penrose 1996a, 1996b).
The Orch OR proposal (Penrose and Hameroff 1995;
Hameroff and Penrose 1996a, 1996b, 2014, 2016) was greeted
skeptically, for example, because of decoherence in the “warm,
wet, and noisy” brain. Technological quantum computers must
operate near absolute zero temperature to avoid thermal disruption of seemingly delicate quantum states, but brain microtubules operate at a warm 37.6 °C. For example, Max Tegmark
(2000) calculated a decoherence time for microtubules at biological temperature as 10−13 s, far too fast for neurophysiology
(e.g., gamma synchrony at t = 25 msec), and an apparent blow
to Orch OR. But, Tegmark’s calculation was based on a

superposition separation distance of 24 nm (a soliton separated
from itself by three tubulin lengths) rather than the femtometer
(10−15 m) separation stipulated in Orch OR, an error of seven
orders of magnitude, bringing the decoherence time to 10−6 s.
Hagan et al. (2001) corrected Tegmark’s own decoherence formula for microtubules, found two smaller errors, and
recalculated a microtubule decoherence time of 10−4 s, approaching neurobiological processes.
The group of Anirban Bandyopadhyay (Sahu et al. 2013a,
2013b, 2014) used nanotechnology at ambient temperatures to
measure quantum resonance conduction in microtubules as a
function of applied alternating current frequency. They found
self-similar conductance patterns at specific frequencies every
few orders of magnitude, i.e., in terahertz, gigahertz, megahertz, and kilohertz, equivalent to the 10−4 s coherence time
predicted by Hagan et al. (2001).
What is time t (equal to h/EG) for conscious moments?
How frequent are conscious moments? Film and video are
composed of individual frames, occurring at a frequency of
about 30 Hz, yet appear continuous. Gamma synchrony EEG
at around 40 Hz is the best measurable correlate of consciousness, so Orch OR first considered time t of 25 ms (1/40 s). For
t = 25 msec, EG is superposition of about 2 × 1010 tubulins.

resonance groups in tubulins (schematic versions with only 3, of 86, pi
resonance groups shown) oscillate in single tubulin, and along a helical

pathway in a microtubule A lattice. Right: quantum superposition of both
tubulin pathways

With about 109 tubulins per neuron, and about 1019 tubulins in
the brain, this represents a small fraction of the brain (20
neurons if all tubulins were involved; 20,000 neurons if
0.1% of tubulins per neuron are involved). So, this would be
only 2 × 10−9 to 2 × 10−7 of brain capacity and require a (long)
coherence time of 25 msec, e.g., relative to the 10−4 s theoretically predicted and experimentally found.
In recent papers (Hameroff and Penrose 2014; 2016
Hameroff 2016), we proposed that Orch OR conscious moments occur at frequencies much faster than electrophysiologically measurable activities like EEG. For example, Orch OR
events could occur at rates in tens of megahertz (107 Hz), with
negative resonance (interference) among microtubules which
oscillate and resonate at slightly different megahertz frequencies, giving rise to “beats.” These can result in slower electrophysiological dynamics including electroencephalographic

(EEG) rhythms. (Despite nearly 100 years of clinical and research use, the origin, significance, brain-wide coherence, and
underlying mechanisms of EEG remain uncertain.) Two (or
more) microtubules oscillating at megahertz frequencies, for
example, 10,000,080 Hz and 10,000,000 Hz would give rise
to 40 Hz oscillation beats, gamma synchrony EEG.
Microtubules in dendrites and soma of neurons, including
cortical pyramidal neurons whose apical dendrites generate
EEG, are in mixed polarity parallel arrays. Neighboring microtubules of different polarity will have slightly different resonant frequencies due to alignment with the overall neuronal
membrane potential. Orch OR predicts that EEG originates as
interference beats of faster oscillations in microtubules, e.g.,
inside apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons.
In the Orch OR picture, the brain is organized as a multiscale, fractal-like structural and dynamical hierarchy

and two non-anesthetic gases which bind where anesthetics
bind, but have no anesthetic action. All eight anesthetics
dampened tubulin terahertz oscillations (shifting the spectrum
to lower frequencies), the shift proportional to potency. Nonanesthetic/non-immobilizer gases did not dampen the
terahertz spectrum. All eight anesthetics abolished the
613 THz peak, whereas the non-anesthetic/non-immobilizer
gases had no such effect. According to computer modeling at
least, quantum terahertz dipole oscillations in microtubules
which correlate with consciousness are selectively inhibited
by anesthetics, and form a key level in the brain’s multi-scale
hierarchy in which consciousness occurs.

extending from slower, larger brain-wide networks to smaller,
faster quantum vibrations in microtubules inside neurons.
Orch OR can occur at any of these frequencies, or resonant
combinations, like music can change scale. The hierarchy can
extend to even faster, smaller scales in spacetime geometry as
predicted by the Orch OR theory (Fig. 6).
Finally, support for the biological aspects of Orch OR may
be sought from the mechanism of action of anesthetic gases
which selectively prevent consciousness, sparing nonconscious brain activity. Anesthetic gases act in brain proteins
through extremely weak quantum interactions called van der
Waals (‘London dipole dispersion’) forces (See ‘pi resonance
oscillations’, Fig. 5). For many years, anesthetics were
thought to act on post-synaptic membrane proteins, but evidence in the past 10 years has pointed instead to anesthetic
action in microtubules (Xi et al. 2004; Pan et al. 2007; Pan et
al. 2008; Emerson et al. 2013). Using computer modeling,
Craddock et al. [2017] simulated collective quantum dipole
oscillations among all 86 pi resonance (aromatic amino acid)
groups in each tubulin in microtubules (Fig. 4), and found a
spectrum of excitations with a common mode peak at
613 THz (613 × 1012 Hz). The simulation was then repeated
with the presence of each of eight different anesthetic gases,

Orch OR portrays consciousness as quantum computations in
microtubules inside brain neurons, each terminated by an “orchestrated objective reduction” conscious moment. Sequences
of such moments give rise to our familiar stream of
consciousness.
The result of each Orch OR moment selects states of microtubules which regulate neuronal and membrane activity,

for example, by influencing axonal firings and synaptic plasticity. Thus, consciousness has causal efficacy in our actions
and perceptions. Evidence suggests anesthesia acts to selectively block consciousness by dampening quantum terahertz
vibrations in microtubules, and thus, Orch OR is better supported experimentally than other neurobiological theories of
consciousness. Orch OR further suggests the brain is organized as a multi-scale hierarchy which extends through 12
orders of magnitude in the brain to the structure of spacetime
geometry.
In the view of von Neumann, Wigner, “Copenhagen,” and
Henry Stapp, quantum state reduction (“collapse of the
wavefunction”) is caused by conscious observation (subjective
reduction (SR)). This leads to a dualist or idealist position in
which conscious observation remains scientifically undefined.
In Orch OR, quantum state reduction occurs spontaneously due
to objective properties in fundamental spacetime geometry (objective reduction (OR)) connected to the brain by quantum
dipole vibrations in microtubules. In Orch OR, consciousness
causes (or is identical to) quantum state reduction.
