Quantum Paradigm of Psychopathology Group
Abstract

The QPP conference in Palermo has marked a definite turning point in the foundational perspective of
a y of the group’s participa ts regarding the study of psychopathology, particularly mood disorders.
One reason for this turning point stems from a realization that two of the most common forms of
psychopathology, major depression and bipolar disorder, may be recognizable by means of
biomolecular markers. Long years of theoretical study by independent investigators have finally
culminated in a convergence of their insights via quantum paradigms that now promise to illuminate,
through the empirically tangible route of such new biomolecular markers, pathological phenomena of
the conscious brain, thus potentially both confirming in fact and further harmonizing the diverse prior
contributions of these conceptually innovative psychiatrists, biochemists, molecular biologists,
philosophers and theologians.

Introduction.
Quantum Mind has been an ongoing
field of study since the final decades of the
last century. Pioneers like the physicists
Hiroomi Umezawa, Kunio Yasue, and
Giuseppe Vitiello, mathematicians like
Roger
Penrose,
and
biomedical
investigators like Stuart Hameroff, Gordon
Globus, and Gustav Bernroider have
plumbed the depths of subatomic
structure
and
its
macroscopic
amplifications in search of substrates for
quantum
computation
and
other
capabilities that may match attributes of
the normal human psyche better than
models
advocated
by
conventional
cognitive neuroscience.
In the domain of psychopathology,
Gordon Globus has gone on to propound a
highly original concept of schizophrenia
linked to the “tuning” of quantum
vibrations suffusing the brain. Nancy
Woolf, along with co-authors including
Jack Tuszynski, has offered credible links

ISSN 1970-223X

between psychopathology and quantumcomputational dysfunction within the
skeletal proteins giving shape to brain
cells. Paavo Pylkkanen has related the
physical substrates of mental illness to
quantum “pilot waves.” Donald Mender
has proposed ways of comprehending the
neurophysiology of disordered thinking
and emotion in terms of quantum "phase
transitional" analogies to the freezing and
melting of ordinary matter; he has also
contributed to a reframing of psychiatric
disease nosology in light of the anthropic
principle.
Ursula
Werneke
has
complimented
this
anthropic
reconsideration through her examination
of psychotically “impaired” reality-testing
in the context of Hugh Everett’s manyworlds ontology. Massimo Cocchi, Lucio
Tonello,
Fabio
Gabrielli,
Massimo
Pregnolato, Paola Zizzi, Eliano Pessa, and
their collaborators have forged links
between serotonin and quantum

phenomena via membrane biophysics in
depression and psychosis.
The above honor roll of seminal QPP
theoreticians is surely not exhaustive, but
these brief remarks are not intended as a
complete historical review. Rather the
purpose is an opening into the possibility
of turning today’s theoretical potentialities
into experimental confirmed reality. It
should be recalled and emphasized as a
guiding principle that the cohesion of a
convivial
multidisciplinary
group
operating
without
the
winnowing
constraints of competing, mutually
exclusive ideas may not remain true to the
epistemic rigors of science. QPP can
minimize this sort of hazard by
maximizing, in the spirit of Karl Popper,
exposure of its most cherished conjectures
to a fair risk of experimental refutation.
A number of participants in the
Palermo conference have signed a
theoretical manifesto, aptly called “The
Declaration of Palermo," whose text
follows:
The Declaration of Palermo
On this day of April 27, 2013 a core
international group of investigators,
offering expertise in the fields of
psychiatry,
biochemistry,
physics,
computational
neuroscience,
mathematics, philosophy and theology,
gathered in Palermo, Sicily under the
auspices of the global QPP initiative with
the aim of assessing the potential
relevance of quantum physics and
quantum chemistry to the mapping of
mind-brain relations in normal and
abnormal
states
of
consciousness
applicable to humans and non-human
animals. Positions taken by members of
the Palermo Group have argued that:
recent progress of a restricted kind in
mainstream consciousness research has
proceeded rapidly due to dramatic
technical improvements in relevant
empirical research tools. Classical
biophysics,
which
provides
the
paradigmatic foundation of mainstream
consciousness research, has offered
bountiful correlations between subjective
reports of qualitative human experience
and quantitative measurements of

ISSN 1970-223X

2

objective physical processes. However,
these merely correlative advances have
not at all addressed what David Chalmers
has termed the “Hard Problem” of mindbrain relations by bridging what Joseph
Levine has called the “Explanatory Gap”
between
qualitatively
subjective
phenomenal experience and quantifiably
objective physical events. So far no
explanatory
bridge
between
consciousness and corporeal neural tissue
has issued from the classical biophysics of
mind and brain in homo sapiens, and, in
research
on
non-human
subjects
precluding self-reports via human
language abilities, even correlations have
remained substantially elusive. Quantum
approaches may offer greater latitude in
addressing these classical deficiencies, to
the extent that at least some latent links
formally exist between the qualitative
dimensionality
and
quantitative
measurability of canonically conjugate
quantum observables, whereas no such
formal links are required with reference
to the possessed observables of classical
physics.
Moreover, at least one interpretation
of quantum measurement as formulated
by John Von Neumann casts the
measuring agency itself as subjectively
conscious per se, in contrast to an absence
of any such classical notion.
Quantum generalization of classical
biophysics opens up the possibility that
relevant brain processes may reach both
beneath the scale and beyond the
boundaries of discrete neurons separated
by synaptic clefts. Quantum-germane
structures and dynamics within the brain
may include superposed dimeric tubulin
conformations in the microtubular
cytoskeleton spanning both intraneuronal
and interneuronal spaces, ordered water
in relation to cytoskeletal proteins,
membrane channels and lipids together
with their second messenger pipe lines to
neuronal
interstices,
and
solitons
communicating along cytoskeletal routes
between classical and quantum aspects of
brain function. Max Tegmark’s objections
to the thermodynamic feasibility of such
quantum structures and processes

biological temperatures entailing orders
of magnitude comparable to those within
the human skull have been thrown into
doubt by the recent work of Gregory
Engel’s group, which has demonstrated
non-trivial quantum computation in
photosynthesis.
The ubiquity of water, cytoskeletal
tubulin, membrane lipids, and second
messengers in non-human life suggests
that a new biophysics, accounting for
quantum-generalized processes in living
tissue, may lead to future predictions
about consciousness not only in human
beings but also in organisms lacking any
semblance of human brain architecture at
the level of organized neuronal networks
or “higher.”
Emmanuel Pothos and Jerome
Busemeyer have presented abundant
empirical evidence that properties of
normal mental life may be more
parsimoniously modeled by abstract
quantum formalisms than by classical
computational algorithms. The quantum
wetware outlined above is more
compatible with these formalistic findings
than is any classical model of neural
biophysics. Both quantum-logical and
quantum-physical cartographies of mind
and brain also promise to generate
avenues for improved comprehension of
neurophysics in psychopathology.
Explanatory
and
even
psychotherapeutic opportunities may
emerge
from
considerations
of
superpositional logic and malattunement
in primary process
thinking
by
schizophrenic patients, of Everett’s
quantum ontology in the “alternate
worlds” of psychotic perception, and of
membrane
and
second-messenger
interfaces between serotonin biochemistry
and quantum-microtubular nanowire
dysfunction in mood disorders.
Aberrations
of
scale-dependent
emergence in quantum thermofield phase
transitions and problematic barriers to
Bohmian holism may be important in
multiple forms of mental illness. We
declare the following:
Even the absence of highly complex
synaptic connections among neurons
does not preclude the presence of at

least
rudimentary
phenomenal
experience in organisms endowed with
superposed
microtubular
dimers,
ordered water, membrane ion channels,
and/or crucial lipid raft assemblies
connected to selected second messenger
systems.
In
addition,
quantumbiophysical aspects of these and/or
other yet unmapped structures and
related processes may prove to be
potent factors in the deeper etiologies
and improved treatments of psychiatric
disorders.

The
above
strong
theoretical
statement invites an opening into possible
experimental models that will test the
accuracy of the group’s hypotheses by
identifying,
starting
from
precise
molecular reference points characterizing
major depression and bipolar disorder, a
non-trivially quantum pathway of relevant
biomolecular changes conditioning brain
processes through the most intimate
aspects of neuronal, transneuronal, and
subneuronal function.
In particular,
membrane viscosity and its role within the
interactome may prove to figure centrally
in quantum-chemical transduction of
normal and pathological neural signals.
The Declaration of Palermo, through
its support for the plausibility of a
quantum basis of consciousness offers
phenomological
conclusions
phenomenologies crucial to both human
beings and other creatures. Homo sapiens
and non-human animals share a core of
conscious awareness that is nevertheless
expressed differently for each kind of
organism at divergent levels, overseeing
management of disparate needs and
actions and realized through behaviour in
relation to concrete variations of the
external environment. The dimension of
“self-consciousness”
hence
can
be
understood to have evolved, step by step,
in phylogenetic progression according to
an admirable order promoting the survival
of each unique life form with respect to the
particular tasks which it has to perform.
Today we are equipped with many
high-end tools in our attempts to
understand all the steps in the evolution of
consciousness, but only through intuition
will we achieve an adequate interpretation
of consciousness itself, that most complex

and extraordinary end product.
Pending such ‘intuition”, some
members of the QPP group have decided
to submit to classical experimental testing
those insights independently adduced by
each contributor through theoretical
inquiry, that is, through the construction
of an empirical map laying bare the most
germane transneuronal, neuronal, and
subneuronal molecular changes with an
eye toward the possibility of inducing and
measuring changes in membrane viscosity
correlated with in vivo manifestation of
mood disorders. As far as we know this is
the first time that such micro-molecular
events will be tied rigorously to molar
cognitive phenomena.
The resulting experimental data may
offer an enduring empirical anchor in
contrast to the intersubjective vagaries
that have afflicted those various
psychiatric disease nosologies, most
recently DSM V, issuing from the hollow
consensus of committees and cultural
contextual fashion. If the experimental
program planned by QPP succeeds, the
goal
of
psychodiagnostic
validity,
heretofore sacrificed by DSM to mere
“inter-rater reliability”, may at last be
achieved.

Molecular and Quantum
Approaches to Psychopathology.
An Interdisciplinary Dialog with
Psychiatrists

The Cunning of the Observable
Donald Mender
L. U. de. S. University, Switzerland; Yale University, USA

This work attempts to pose, address,
and then apply to an understanding of
psychopathology a question which will be
called Heisenberg's Hard Problem. The
issue can be stated as follows: Can the
"explanatory gap" between quantities and
qualia, famously afflicting the philosophy
of mind, be narrowed by a deepened
understanding of the reasons that

ISSN 1970-223X

4

quantifiably observable qualities appear
naturally to be grouped in sets of two
distinct types, i. e. 1) canonically conjugate
operators displaying fourier duality and 2)
all others?
We might speculate that the answer is
yes, given two considerations. First, the
Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation of
measurement
encompassing
latent
physical observables offers strong parallels
with the crucial nexus of practical agency
and risk in Heidegger’s post-metaphysical
penetration of subjectivity. Second, some
psychologists (Pothos, 2013) have recently
proposed expanding the qualitatively open
set of possible "possessed" observable
dimensionalizations to include "qualia"
lying outside the standard physical domain
of causally complete dynamics.
The established scientific success of
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle warns
us that any new psychophysically
promising
bridgehead
across
the
latent/possessed divide must eschew
retrograde
retreat
into
exclusively
classical, possessed, commutative notions
of canonically conjugate observables. A
unified quantum-psychophysical approach
should instead more progressively posit
novel theoretical conduits through which
non-conjugate qualia may aggregate as
sets whose internal relations harbor an
occult fourier duality, distinctive insofar as
this
non-conjugate
fourier
duality
dynamically "hides in plain sight" and
appears in a misleadingly "possessed"
guise under conditions of traditional
physical measurement. One might require
the "cunning" of such non-conjugate
pseudo-possessed qualia to maintain their
disguise of apparent mutual compatibility
through seeming conformity with classical
and
unitary
determinism
and
commensurately with known measurable
behaviors of neurophysiologically localized
and
behaviorally
proximate
assays
entailing mainstream notions of physical
cause and effect. In addition, the hidden
fourier-dual latency of the "cunning" nonconjugate qualia would be required not to
boomerang, in any locally obtrusive
manner
detectable
by
standard
experimental means now in use, as an
anomalous back door influence on

canonically conjugate constraints under
principles
of
quantum
mechanical
uncertainty.
The preliminary outlines of a possible
model (Mender, 2013) for such cryptocausal hiding in plain sight by nonconjugate pairs of quantifiable qualities
will be advanced in this talk. The
postulated model will seek to enlist a settheoretically reframed ensemble of
conceivable "floppy" manifolds to which in
toto the skew-symmetric vector space of
fourier-dual canonical conjugation may be
considered “probabilisticallly” tangent
(Penrose, 2005). It will be suggested that
the set-theoretically reframed manifolds
might be configured toward two
"metaphysical" ends: a) compensatory
gauge-like "curvature" which could "warp"
non-conjugate sets of qualia into
canonically conjugate observables and b)
extrinsic rather than intrinsic behavior of
that curvature, whose expected physicotopological manifestations could thereby
"hide” locally while emerging “in plain
sight” across a global perspective.
Probability-valued aspects of the above
set-theoretic
revisions
open
up
possibilities
that
statistical
interrelationships
among
acts
of
measurement may depart from their
traditionally understood behavior, which
is known to occur in the limiting case of
discrete experimental observations.
It might then be theorized that, as the
density of observational acts radically
increases toward "flicker-fusion" within an
effectively
continuous
stream
of
consciousness,
statistics
interrelating
those subjectively generated acts of
observational
agency
(rather
than
governing merely the wave-functional
probabilities of observed physical objects)
may diverge into Bose-Einstein and FermiDirac components. Sources of potential
torsion inherent within transformations
from tangent skew-symmetry to fully
arrayed ensembles of manifolds also raise
the question of a subjective measuring
agent’s possible association with novel
spin-like moments.
Such spin-statistical considerations in
the contexts of supersymmetry and the
diffusely
distributed
character
of

gravitational negentropy (Penrose, 2005)
may point toward a new conceptual
platform for psychophysical causation.
Radicalized psychophysics might bridge
the phenomenal "explanatory gap" by
escaping causal locality and finding
empirically accessible expression not in
local neural generators but instead, more
subtly and cryptically, through diffuse
scalar fields.
Those Higgs-like, quasi-quintessential
entities, insofar as they extend in global
topological relationship to extrinsic
curvature, may in turn delimit the
homeomorphic
signposts,
including
genus-like properties, of relevant manifold
ensembles. Inserted topological “genus”
values might thereby impose on the
affected manifold ensembles tunable
boundary conditions. Hence, it is also in
problematic
bicontinuities
of
such
disseminated scalar fields, rather than
focal neurological lesions, that evidence
may
be
found
for
postulated
malattunements (Globus, 2010), deviating
from hyper-anthropic (Mender, 2011)
resonances, as highly correlated physical
expressions of aberrant qualitative
experience.

Orthótes
as
metaphysical
violence. Major Depression and
Bipolar Disorder: from ideology
to biology
Fabio Gabrielli
L.U.de.S. University, Switzerland

The accuracy of the metaphysical
viewpoint resulting from an original
cognitive desire (Gabrielli 2009, 2013),
epistemic reflection on the becoming seen
as anthropological anguish – implodes
into ideology, when it turns into violent
interpretation of reality, the primacy of
words over things, arbitrary and interested
manipulation of facts (macro and micro
power).
The metaphysical ideology finds a
privileged breeding ground in mental
diseases, when social and cultural
conditioning takes on a metaphysical value
because of the often faded match between
classification and natural object, nosology
and actual disease reality.
Hence the danger that such a strong
medical ideologism could flares up into
diagnostic imperialism. In our opinion, the
weakness
of
DSM
classifications,
particularly as to the distinction between
MD and BD, results from the lack of a
strong and real biological equivalent,
capable of proving diagnoses which are
merely narrative, based on literature or
apparent only in the psychotic onset
(Cocchi, 2012a,b). In light of these
considerations, we believe we have
identified during our experimental path
(Paolo Sotgiu Institute) the biological
markers which provide the MD and BD
diagnoses with an extremely real
foundation to be used for establishing a
DSM free from pseudophenomenology or,
even worse, ideology, and focused on the
here and now of consciousness in its real
biomolecular flesh (Cocchi 2011, 2012c-h,
2013a-b; Gabrielli, 2012).

A dialogue between ethics and
neuroscience
Michele Aramini
Catholic University, Milan, Italy

The neurosciences have ranked genetics
as a leading sector of the medical scientific
research. Their development is due to new
diagnostic technologies (PET, SPECT,
MRI, fMRI, EEG, MEG, ERP). These tools
can help establish correlations between
physical events and mental events, to the
point that some people think that the mind
is only a secondary phenomenon of the
brain, and that every mental state is in
principle reducible to the physical
dimension below. Another position asserts
that mental states while being tied to
specific configuration of the brain are,
however, "emerging", id est they have their
own originality.
An examination of the relationship
between
neuroscientific
data
and
philosophical interpretations of the
relationship mind brain is the first point of
ethical evaluation. A second point is
constituted
by
the
possibility
of
pharmacological interventions able to
induce very specific functional changes
(Farah and Volpe, 2004).
These two aspects are important for our
understanding of ourselves as beings with
a life mental and spiritual. Hence the birth
of neuroethics.
Several elements enter in the definition:
Study of the neural correlates of emotions
and moral decisions, and Reflection that
deals with the implications of the right and
wrong treatment or enhancement of the
human brain. In this case it would be just a
chapter of bioethics. Another position
asserts that the more deeply it comes to
ISSN 1970-223X

producing a philosophy of life based on the
brain. The position of Gazzaniga can have
two meanings: that knowledge of the brain
mechanisms is necessary for the
understanding of ourselves, and, more
radically, that the neuroscientific point of
view should be the decisive one in the
definition of bioethical issues. Based on
this, the embryo has no value before the
formation of the brain, because we are our
brains. Thesis is not new (Green and
Wikler, 1980) which also involves the
release by the human species of patients
victims of dementia. Leaving aside the
criticism that they can turn to this
simplistic
approach,
interest
in
neuroethics is another: Is it ethical
problems resulting from the use of current
or future scientific tools that allow you to
learn more about the cerebral phenomena,
and to take action to change them? Are the
therapeutic and application radically new
acting on the brain alter the experience
and behavior of people? There are two
aspects to be considered (Farah , 2005):
the practical application of neuroscientific
knowledge, the theoretical aspect that
affects our self-interpretation, to the point
of subverting the ordinary conception of
ethics.
There
are
many
possible
applications, all with ethical implications.
Read
minds?
The
neuroimaging
techniques seem to allow direct access to
the personality of the individual, or at least
to the physical structures that allow the
expression. There is therefore the question
of individual privacy. It seems that we can
measure
what
people
think,
the
propensities of stable behavior (McClure,
2004), the tendency to violence or to racist
attitudes. It can thus assume fingerprint
brain predictive of the future. Remarks: is
not at all certain that these detection
systems of the brain activity may never
become sufficiently reliable (Farah and
Volpe, 2004). The brain imaging data
provides fascinating, not incontrovertible
evidence. For example, the predisposition
to antisocial behavior does not necessarily
translate
into
concrete
actions.
Improve the performance of the mind?
Another area of application is the
enhancement of cognitive performance
and the psychological and emotional state.

Think of the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), which have side effects
modest compared to the benefits in the
symptoms,
self-esteem
and
social
relationships of individuals with mental
disorders are not clearly diagnosable
(Knutson, 1998).
Research is ongoing on medicines that
improve sleep, appetite and sexual activity
(Flower, 2004). But the most important is
that of cognitive activities, such as
attention and memory. In this context,
they spread off-label uses of existing drugs
(Diller, 1996). This raises questions of
safety in the use of these drugs, but also
ethical issues. Exceeding the natural limits
is not perhaps a new form of eugenics? In
which individual freedom is only
theoretical, since there is a push to not lag
behind, such doping in sport? (Rose,
2002). So we introduce a subtle coercive
mechanism, especially in schools and the
military, as happens in the USA. A more
theoretical problem is the effect of these
changes in mental abilities of personal
identity and individual autonomy. The
person whose memory and whose
cognitive abilities and emotional have
been profoundly altered is still the same
person? yet the author of himself, his
actions and personality (Degrazia, 2005).
The question that is posed by the
decision neuroscience is that of the
naturalization
of
the
mind
and
consciousness, namely the reduction of
spiritual phenomena to their material
bases and settlement of moral experience
which we have known so far. Brain
functioning and eclipses of freedom.
Gazzaniga argues that the brain is 1) a
physical entity subject to the deterministic
laws of the physical world, and 2) a
specialized mainly in the formation of
beliefs, thanks to the activity of the left
hemisphere, which interprets the external
inputs, a modular system, in which the
different parts operating in parallel and
independently, without constituting an
integrated structure and parallel. From
this vision leads to some important
consequences for the ethical: A) there is no
central I in the strong sense, the Cartesian
cogito. The unity of consciousness would
be a construction of the left hemisphere .

ISSN 1970-223X

B) The conscious mental states, beliefs and
decisions that we believe are our only
posthumous awareness of what happened
to the different parts of the brain. C) the
most important consequence is that the
mind becomes nothing more than a
"product" of the brain, ie an appearance
epiphenomenal no causal efficacy. In fact,
we tell ourselves stories to feed the illusion
of free and rational decisions. The ego is
nothing but the press officer of the various
agencies cognitive brain, not their
president. In this way it gets rid of free
will. The moral as conservation of the
species. The abolition of free will not lead
to the disappearance of moral behavior,
indeed. Since it is necessary for social life,
it is stated that evolution would have
selected some forms of instinctive
response, for the protection of human
survival. These forms would have been
progressively
integrated
into
the
mechanisms of brain functioning. In this
way, we would face a universal morality.
Marc Hauser tried to test this hypothesis
through the study of moral dilemmas.
What people sacrifice, whether to stop to
rescue a wounded man, etc. It has been
found that non-personal moral dilemmas
activated areas similar to the non-moral
and practical dilemmas that moral
dilemmas relating to persons who require
more time. In the same line ranging
research related to mirror neurons, which
would be the basis of empathy among
humans, an essential element to their
cohabitation. An universal natural ethic.
The study of the neural basis of moral
judgment and behavior seem to be able to
conduct a proper naturalization of ethics.
The moral systems would be variations of
a universal system of rules and reaction
devices innate in our species, who work for
the survival of the species. As we have seen

This
methodological aspect must become
incorrect when it becomes ontological
claims concerning that is the whole of
reality. In fact, every phenomenon can be
investigated by other methods and
knowledge with other intentions. Although
scientific knowledge is, in principle, a
fallible and partial knowledge, which
always requires to be corrected and
supplemented. Particularly important is
the assumption of some research that
there is a neural basis for the emotions and
the only reasons why we are moral agents.
Now this assumption is not shown: it is
not proven causality between brain events
and mental events. In addition, we may
wonder why the causality cannot act in
reverse: that a certain area of the brain is
activated because the individual has taken
a
certain
decision.
The
causal
interpretation
that
interprets
the
relationship between physical and mental
health depends on implicit bias in many
studies, that the reduction of all that we
belong to a higher level (spiritual or
cultural) to its biological basis is only a
matter of time. Gazzaniga says: we are the
only large animals. All other explanations
that give us comfort are just stories. But
there is no Santa Claus. The thesis is
unproven that science explains everything
there is to explain, and that still does not
explain who will explain it in the future.
Moral pluralism. Research by Hauser
and Greene indicate the possibility of
intervening on the neural processes with
an override, so the education and culture
act themselves on the neural mechanisms.
To respond immediately overwrites the
neural response of a different type of
values. So there are utilitarians, emotivists
and theorists of virtue, Kantian, etc. How
come? Really this difference would be
written in neurons? We are born with a
brain Kantian or utilitarian? What if the
moral neural responses serve to save the
species, how can we explain the behavior
radically amoral or immoral? We can
legitimately think that research on mental
correlates of moral experience lie on the
floor of a descriptive analysis, but they
cannot explain moral experience, much
less provide prescriptions for how we

should judge or act. In substance between
the '"is" neural and "must" morale there is
a jump that can only be filled by individual
freedom, supported by education and by
the influence of moral theories (Greene,
2003). The human being is a spring of
individual decisions. Neuroethics can tell
us how the brain conditions can influence
subjective decisions, but it cannot tell us
why those decisions are made.

New developments in quantum
field theory modeling of the brain
and living matter
Giuseppe Vitiello
University of Salerno, Italy

We have devised a thermodynamic
model
of
cortical
neurodynamics
expressed at the classical level by neural
networks and at the quantum level by
dissipative
quantum
field
theory
(Freeman, 2004-2006; Vitiello 1995,
2001; Freeman and Vitiello 2006, 2008;
Capolupo, 2013). Our dissipative model is
based on features in the spatial images of
cortical activity newly revealed by highdensity electrode arrays. We have
incorporated the mechanism and necessity
for so-called dark energy in knowledge
retrieval (Capolupo, 2013). We postulate
that the extremely high density of energy
sequestered briefly in cortical activity
patterns can account for the vividness,
richness of associations, and emotional
intensity of memories recalled by stimuli.
The dissipative quantum model
(Vitiello, 1995) enables an orderly
description that includes all levels of the
microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic
organization of the cerebral patterns. By
repeated trial-and-error each brain
constructs within itself an understanding
of its surround, the knowledge of its own
world that we describe as its Double
(Vitiello, 2001). The relations that the self
and its surround construct by their
interactions constitute the meanings of the
flows of information exchanged during the
interactions. In such a dialog of the self
with his Double resides the act of
consciousness (Vitiello 1995, 2001). The
perception-action arc in the MerleauPonty’s phenomenology of perception
finds its representation and formal
description in the frame of the dissipative
model. In the dialog with the Double, the
continuous attempt to reach the
equilibrium shows that the real goal
pursued by the brain activity is the
aesthetical experience, the perfect “to-bein-the-world”, the aesthetical dimension
characterized by the “pleasure” of the
perception (Vitiello, 2001).

ISSN 1970-223X

10

The aesthetical experience arising from
the search of the perfect fitting of the self
in the world through the “active response”
of the self to the world and the reciprocal
action of the world on the self,
continuously renews itself since the dialog
of the self with his Double is of dynamical
origin, never concluded or terminated,
always opening new horizons to be
explored.
Active
responses
imply
responsibility and thus they become
moral, ethical responses through which
the self and its Double become part of the
larger social dialog. Aesthetical pleasure
unavoidably
implies
disclosure,
to
manifest “signs”, artistic communication.
An interpersonal, collective level of
consciousness then arises, a larger stage
where again the actors are mutually
dependent, each one bounded (entangled)
in his very existence (including any sort of
physical needs) to the other ones, simply
non-existing without the others.
The coherent structure of the brain
background state, or minimum energy
state, manifests itself in the auto-similarity
properties of fractal structures (Vitiello,
2009; Freeman and Zhai, 2009; Gireesh
and Plenz, 2008; Petermanna, 2009)
which are observed to occur also in a large
number of natural phenomena and
systems. This leads us to a unified physical
understanding at the ecological scale
(Vitiello 2009, 2012). The conception of
Nature split in closed, separated domains
is replaced by the vision of Nature
modulated and unified by laws of form
implied by the underlying quantum
dynamics of the coherent vacuum. Any
distinction or antinomy between structure
and function is dissolved in such an
integrated ecological vision.

A quantum

theory

of

Gordon Globus
University of California Irvine, U.S.A.

Freud (1990) thought that the
interpretation of dreams would provide
the Via Regia, the royal way, to the
unconscious mind and hence to an
understanding
of
psychopathology.
Dreams provide a window into how the
illogical mind works, since the dominating
influence of sensory input is inhibited and
the functioning of the freed mental
apparatus comes into view.
The issue to be addressed here is not
what the dream means but what it shows

ISSN 1970-223X

about the underlying brain mechanisms. It
is remarkable that sans sensory input, yet
dream worlds can be indiscernable from
the worlds of waking life (Globus, 1987).
How might authentic worlds be formed by
the sleeping brain? Compositions of
memory traces will not do. The shifts in
dream scene (when we say amazedly in
recounting the dream, “and the next thing
I knew …”) are especially instructive. A
theory of dream formation will be offered
in terms of thermofield brain dynamics
(Globus, 2009).

Founding
our
mathematical
description of our perception of
nature on the properties of
consciousness
Efstratios Manousakis
Florida State University, USA.

In this presentation, I will argue that
quantum theory can be founded on the
framework of consciousness, in contrast to
earlier suggestions that consciousness
might be understood starting from
quantum theory. Contrary to the idea that
consciousness is an emergent property of
matter, we postulate that consciousness is
primary and the material universe emerges
as an epiphenomenon (Manousakis 2006,
2009, 2012).
The notion of streams of consciousness,
usually restricted to conscious beings, is
extended
to
the
notion
of
a
Universal/Global stream of conscious flow
of ordered events. The streams of
conscious events which we experience
constitute sub-streams of the Universal
stream. We will discuss that consciousness
can be either in a potential or unmanifested state or in an actual state

www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

which leads to the stream of conscious
events.
Our postulated ontological character of
consciousness is operational, namely, it
acts on the state of potential consciousness
to create events or modify the likelihood
for later events to occur and become part
of the Universal conscious flow. A
generalized process of measurementperception is introduced, where the
operation of consciousness brings into
existence, from the state of potentiality,
the event in consciousness.
This is mathematically represented by
(a) an operator acting on the state of
potential-consciousness before an actual
event arises in consciousness and (b) the
reflecting of the result of this operation
back onto the state of potentialconsciousness for comparison in order for
the event to arise in consciousness.
Beginning from our postulate that the
ontological status of consciousness is
primary and from its elementary and basic
contents, such as perception of periodic
change and motion, quantum theory
follows naturally as the description of the
conscious experience. The presentation
will include simple demonstration of these
ideas as well as examples of their
applicability.

Quantum logic, the collective
unconscious and the biological
basis of psychopathology

The logic of the normal unconscious
mind and of schizophrenic consciousness
may be Lq, the logic of quantum
information (Zizzi, 2010). The PenroseHameroff Orch OR model of consciousness
was first proposed in 1995 and more
recently revised in 2011. Orch OR asserts
that microtubular protein polymers inside
brain neurons act as quantum computers.
Tubulin components of microtubules are
understood to constitute a “Schrodinger’s
protein”
existing
in
quantum
superposition of different states and hence
encoding quantum bits, or qubits of
information (Hameroff 1995, 2007).
The Penrose-Hameroff model argues
that quantum-superposed states develop
in tubulin, remain coherent, and recruit
progressively more superposed tubulins
until, over a time interval lasting up to 500
msec, a mass-time-energy threshold,
related to quantum gravity, is finally
reached. This model predicts dendritic
webs of approximately 100,000 neurons
subserving discrete conscious moments, or
frames, occurring every 25 ms in gamma
synchrony.
For a healthy mind passage from the
unconscious state to the conscious state is
marked, according to the Orch-OR model
of Penrose and Hameroff, by a
decoherence of tubulin qubits. This may be
comprehended in terms of very fast
switches from the quantum logic of the
unconscious to the classical logic of
consciousness.
In Lq, propositional syntax is
configured in qubits, i. e. quantum
information units, which are linear
superpositions of classical bits. It is in this
sense that the unconscious mind may be
formally
interpreted
as
quantum-

www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

informational. The quantum concept of
truth within Lq is different from that of
classical truth, insofar as classical truth is
single-valued and deterministic while in
contrast quantum truth manifests itself as
many-valued (fuzzy) and probabilistic
(Zizzi, 2012a).
Physical interpretation of quantum
logical coherence should take into
consideration concepts of quantum
coherence not only in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics (QM) but also in
relativistic quantum field theory (QFT)
(Zizzi, 2012b; Vitiello 1995, 2001).
Quantum coherence in QM is a property of
pure states, whose linear superposition is
also a pure state, whereas the concept of
coherence is different in QFT, for which
coherent states are eigenstates of the
annihilation operator (Zizzi, 2009; Pessa,
2009). The above-described coherent
framework lends meaning and potency to
quantitative
perspectives
on
psychopathology.
Whereas in mental health Lq is used for
very short time intervals, in the case of
schizophrenia Lq becomes dominant and
long lasting. This predominance of Lq in
schizophrenia might well stem from flaws
in the quantum metalanguage (QML),
those flaws entailing perhaps a dearth of
requisitely configured assertions (Zizzi,
2012c). Because of strict relations between
the QML and the brain’s dissipative
quantum field theory (DQFT), one may
hope to find within the QML’s flaws those
pathological quantum dissipative brain
processes which are responsible for
schizophrenia. If, for example, the
reversibility of “quantum logic gates” for
some reason were to become blocked so
that it was no longer possible to perform
inverse operations such as decoherence
and disentanglement, the mind would
remain trapped in the quantumcomputational unconscious.
It should be said that these quantum
logic gates are indeed material structures,
formed by atoms, ions, etc. Hence, it is
plausible to hypothesize that the drugs
currently used to ameliorate schizophrenia
may somehow reset at least partially and
temporarily damaged quantum logic gates
in the brain (Zizzi, 2012d).

Is there any correlation between
hallucinations and molecular interactions
within the cell or any cause of concscious
state change that may be detectable by
measuring gamma synchrony, which is
well correlated with consciousness and has
already provided response variability in
different psychopathological conditions
and in meditation?
Apart
from
recently
identified
neurochemical, physiological, and classical
functional manifestations, and apart from
the logical issues raised by the term
“formal thought disorder”, schizophrenia
is broadly known as a state of being “out of
touch” with reality. In this context,
hallucinations experienced by patients
suffering from schizophrenia and other
psychoses are commonly considered to
represent a perceptual subset of
detachments
from
reality
with
nonperceptual detachments categorized
separately as delusions (Flynn, 2008;
Cocchi, 2011).
To better understand the implications
of hallucinatory phenomena linked to
schizophrenia also at the molecular level,
many studies using Lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD-25) have been done.
LSD has been dubbed a “consciousnessexpanding drug.” Recreational doses of
LSD can affect 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5HT5A, 5-HT5B, and 5-HT6 receptors, and
the psychedelic effects of LSD are
attributed to its strong partial agonist
effects at 5-HT2A receptors.
Does additional LSD binding to tubulin
alter the conformational structure of
microtubules and consequently their
quantum computations? To explore the
potential binding of different psychoactive
drugs we first performed the Ascalaph
Molecular Dynamics and Conformation
optimization in water medium of several
drugs’ molecule structures.
We then started to study LSD binding
by using HEX Protein Docking (Ritchie,
2010), based on research with rotational
electrostatic
evaluation,
accelerated
through FFT (ie using the so-called
Spherical Polar Fourier Correlations). At
the end of the computation HEX collects
the best results in spatially arranged
clusters. We chose the best energy

www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

solution, corresponding to the first cluster.
These procedures were compared to the
docking performed on tubulin structure
and taxol with the bovine taxol-tubulin
1JFF downloaded from RCS PDB. We also
confirmed that taxol, at the best binding
energy produced by HEX, is in the same
position it has in the crystallographic PDB
source. We then extended the binding
studies
on
microtubules
portions.
Preliminary results of LSD and Heroin
show a specific binding site in tubulin and
microtubule portions. The study will be
extended to all the structures previously
optimized, and the conformational
changes of the protein-drug complex will
be evaluated. These in silico studies should
be indicative of the in vitro behavior of the
microtubule in solution as determined by
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectra of selected spin probes to obtain
structural and dynamical information in
the presence of the psychoactive drug
(Ottaviani, 2012).
Data in the recent literature and from
our experiments seem to be consistent
with the hypothesis that interactome
Schrödinger proteins and in particular the
cytoskeleton nanowire network comprise
the best biological interface for potential
expression of consciousness, being typical
and distinct for each animal species, and
that consciousness in animals is thus
always a possibility. A deeper study of
consciousness-altering drugs and their
binding to tubulin and microtubules may
help us to understand the complex
biological interface between conscious and
unconscious states and to better
understand the various forms of
psycopathology in a deeper physical and
meta-physical
framework.
Scientific
research in this field should focus on the
study of quantum mind and the quantum
brain, which are psychiatrically crucial
instantiations of quantum logic and
quantum physics, respectively.
In addition, scientists should directly
assay behavioral aspects of thoughtdisordered subjects and analyze the results
from a quantum-paradigmatic viewpoint
in order to design and appropriately
individualize quantum technologies for
purposes

communication. These considerations
notwithstanding, the possibility of building
a different approach for information is also
within our horizons of expectation. The
two potential ways - quantum gates on
qbits and Licata’s Hamiltonians with
constraints - are complementary. Qbits are
more useful when we are interested in
individuating a specific state and shows a
natural affinity for the problems typical of
nanotechnologies.
A geometrical means of handling
quantum information is more fruitful
when we endeavor to study the global
evolution of a system without forcing its
nonlocal nature in any way. This latter
mode of investigation clearly requires new
formal tools based on dissipative quantum
field theories (Licata, 2012).

G proteins and lipid rafts as
regulators of both microtubules
and mood
Mark M. Rasenick
University of Ilinois Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago

Background. Lipid rafts are specialized
membrane domains rich in cholesterol and
intimately associated with cytoskeletal
components. G protein signaling is
influenced by lipid rafts, but, depending
upon the receptor, G protein, and effector
enzyme, signaling components are either
brought into close association or driven
into separate membrane microdomains
(Allen 2007, 2009). The former facilitates
signaling and the latter attenuates
signaling. We have demonstrated that, for
Gs and Gs-coupled receptors (adrenergic, VPAC and 5HT-4, -6, -7), lipid
rafts attenuate signaling by sequestering
Gs and adenylyl cyclase in separate
membrane compartments. Experiments
from several different laboratories suggest
a post-synaptic effect of chronic
antidepressants
and
a
possible
postsynaptic target for these drugs. Data
from rats, cultured neural and glial cells,
all suggest that the localization of the G

protein, Gs, in lipid rafts is modified by
chronic treatment with a number of
antidepressant compounds (Donati and
Rasenick, 2005; Zhang and Rasenick,
2010), and this can be screened rapidly by
Fluorescence
Recovery
After
Photobleaching (FRAP). Antidepressants
facilitate translocation of Gs from lipid
rafts while post mortem studies show
increased Gs in raft fractions from
several brain regions of depressed suicide
subjects relative to controls (Donati,
2007). Antidepressants also concentrate in
lipid raft fractions (Eisensamer, 2005). In
this study, we sought to determine
whether raft fractions prepared from
platelets of depressed subjects showed
enrichment of Gs in lipid raft fractions
and learn the manner in which
antidepressants reversed this. We also
hoped to determine whether the
association between Gs and tubulin that
results in increased microtubule dynamics
(Dave, 2011) and increased neuroplasticity
(Yu, 2009) was altered by chronic
antidepressant treatment.
Methods. Blood from volunteers (n = 9)
or newly diagnosed MDD subjects (n = 15)
was collected at the Marche Regional
Psychiatric
Clinic
(Ancona
Italy),
separated into component fractions
(Platelets, RBC and WBC), coded and
shipped to Chicago for assay. Platelet Gs
was extracted, sequentially with Triton X100 (non-raft fraction) and Triton X 114
(raft fraction) and Gs was identified and
quantified by immunoblotting. C6 cells
were transfected, stably, with a monomeric
version of a fluorescent Gs fusion protein
(Yu and Rasenick, 2002) and clones were
selected by fluorescence cell sorting. Cells
were treated chronically with a variety of
antidepressants and FRAP was conducted
on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.
Results. Gs in the lipid raft fraction was
significantly (p<.0001) greater in platelets
prepared from depressed subjects than
those from normal controls. Chronic
antidepressant treatment of cells revealed
increased
recovery

after
photobleaching. Related compounds like
chlorpromazine or lithium did not have
this effect. Finally, Gs, internalized via
lipid raft vesicles, was released from those

vesicles and increased both microtubule
dynamics and neurite outgrowth. The
molecular interface between tubulin and
Gs was revealed, and 15 amino acid
peptides corresponding to this interface
were effective at promoting microtubule
dynamics.
Conclusions. This suggests the possible
development of a simple blood test to
indicate the presence of depression and
may also serve as a rapid indicator of
antidepressant response. Fluorescent Gs
may also serve as a screening tool for
development
of
antidepressant
compounds as well as a personalized
profile for antidepressant selection. The
interface between Gs and tubulin may
play
a
role
in
communicating
neurotransmitter signals to the process of
synaptic rearrangement.

A quantum psychopathological
account of anorexia nervosa
Andrew Marlow
Birmingham, U.K.

Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a mental
disorder characterised by a refusal to
maintain body weight at or above 85% of
the minimally normal weight for age and
height, an intense fear of gaining weight
and a disturbance in the way in which
one’s body is perceived such that the
sufferer is often unable to see that s/he is
underweight (DSM4, 1994). Contemporary
psychodynamic (Bruch, 1973; Lawrence,
2001; Krueger, 2002; Lemma, 2009;
Curiel-Levy, 2012), feminist (McKinley,
2002) and neuropsychological (Klump and
Gobrogge, 2005; Duvvuri , 2010) accounts
of AN present only partial and sometimes
conflicting accounts of this disorder.
A quantum psychopathological account
of AN might therefore enrich our
understanding of this disorder by
providing links between the social and the
neural explanations for AN while at the
same time adding substantially to their
depth. In this vein, this talk follows and
builds on the recent work of Donald
Mender, who has suggested that Quantum

Paradigms of Psychopathology (QPP)
might be preferable to the currently
prevalent biopsychosocial model of mental
illness, and who has more specifically
suggested that Quantum Theories of Mind
might
offer
a
way
to
render
psychoanalytical accounts of mental illness
scientifically falsifiable (Mender, 2010).
The first part of this talk will provide a
brief yet thorough account of the
psychodynamic,
feminist
and
neuropsychological accounts of AN; the
second
will consider how Quantum
Theories of Mind (Jibu and Yasue, 1995;
Hameroff, 2007; Stapp, 2012) might be
useful in our understanding of AN,
examining specifically their impact on
neuropsychology,
their
impact
on
psychotherapy and finally the possibility of
developing a Quantum Object Relations
(QOR) account of AN, based on Mender’s
suggestion that “sociable” bosons might
account for the impact of internalised
‘objects’ on a patient’s mental health, as
identified in the psychoanalytic literature.

Neural
d-separations
and
transient
brain
dynamics:
unraveling the causal chain from
brain space to mind
Gustav Bernroider
Department for Organismic Biology, Neurosignaling Unit,
University of Salzburg, Austria

I attempt to demonstrate the skeleton
version for a causal structure that links
brain dynamics with subjective experience.
Brain states seem to switch between two
opposing characteristics and this switch is
accompanied by phenomenal signatures.
The defining properties of these
characteristics can be described by two
sets of tightly interwoven conceptions.
Directed cyclic causal relations (DCG)

among the variables involved and their
related statistical independencies on one
hand and the topological characteristics
(dimensional excess) of the transients
between variables, providing a transition
algebra that can be mapped into the state
matrix of an underlying (quantum)physical system on the other. Thus the
combined conception units causality,
statistics, dimensionality and physics
(CSDP). Several highly relevant and
testable predictions emerge from these
conceptions. For example, brain states that
involve d-separated causal states should be
detectable
by
their
conditional
independencies among the involved
variables and these in turn are realized
across dimensionally discordant (i.e.
fractal) structures, combining lower and
higher resolution processes and involving
the quantum physical scale. I will provide
a list of recent experimental evidence that
is highly supportive for the predictions
emerging from this theory.
Experience is at the center of all life
forms. This seemingly basic property of
our organization remains remarkably
resistant to a causal relation to the
processing architecture of our brain. A
main reason that seems to nurture this
neglect is the lack of a convincing causal
relation of the regulatory elements behind
brain signaling to the subjectivephenomenal states associated with these
elements. In fact, we do not even know the
precise nature of these regulatory elements
and their target variable, the agent’s
mental state, is not well integrated within
the traditional domain of physicalism. As
can be expected, the commonalities of
these limitations result in rather vague
conceptual definitions (e.g. ‘cognition’)
and give rise to inevitable problems in the
understanding of concepts such as life,
conscious experience, intelligence and
social cognition, the experience of free will
and the sense of agency and finally, the
control of mood and affect. To understand
the adaptive recruiting of these abilities
into the personality of the experiencing
subject may well be a prerequisite for a
progress in our understanding of mental
health and psychiatric disorders in
general. Given the recent explosion of

highly demanding biophysical brain
studies and the resulting amount and
heterogeneity of complex data, the present
situation unmistakably calls for a
theoretical framework that can integrate
network dynamics with mental states.
The outline I propose is inspired by
theories of statistical causal inference as
the ones developed by Pearl (1988),
Spirtes, Glymour & Scheines (2001) and
Shipley (2004). The focus of these
concepts is the relation of causal structures
to theories of conditional independence,
i.e.
probability
theories
and
measurements. However, the defining
properties of the theory suggested here
differ in several important aspects from a
standard causal path analysis. First,
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of causal
relations as suggested by Spirtes et al.
(2001) are replaced by directed cyclic
graphs (DCGs), graphically demonstrated
within their natural frame in 2dimensions. This aspect opposes the
frequently held prejudice against circular
reasoning but renders acyclic directed
causation as special sample sections, one
dimensional pieces cut out from a cyclic
structure, that would be required to fully
capture the phenomenon. Cyclic causation,
as demonstrated here, provides the formal
structure for positive and negative
feedback loops in brain dynamics. It allows
for the type of reciprocal causation that
lays at the core of most regulatory
elements in biological signaling, ranging
from cellular signals, as reviewed by
Brandman and Meyer (2008), to recent
models of evolutionary processes, as for
example reviewed by Laland et al. (2011).
Yet, there is an important additional
aspect that adds the spices to the present
outline. This aspect connects quantum
mechanical concepts to causal brain
dynamics, a connection that is still a
matter of debates, unresolved and
controversial, but gaining grounds by the
recent developments in quantum biology
2012a,b).
Regarding
(Bernroider,
causation and statistics, it has been
demonstrated (Spirtes, 2001) how causal
hypotheses translate into structured
statistical models, eventually allowing for
inferences from statistics to causal

structures. But these relations go much
further. D-separations between variables
not just map into statistical models of
independence,
but
also
into
the
dimensional characteristics of their
connections. The presence of a causal dseparation in DCGs adds a part of an
additional dimension to the topology of it
is outline. The emerging fractality can then
be mapped into the density matrix of the
underlying (quantum-) physical system. I
therefore finally argue that the seek for
causal relations between neural dynamics
and the phenomenology of experience
most probably entails a visitation across
different spatio-temporal resolutions of
the underlying dynamics. The brain states
switch between dimensionally concordant
and physically coherent states and
dimensionally discordant and physically
de-cohered states. This switch is causally
related to experience.

As a result of quantitative molecular
evaluations, concerning the fatty acids of
platelets in human subjects with mood
disorders (Cocchi 2008, 2010), and
through the use of complex mathematical
functions such as artificial neural network
(Self Organizing Map) (Kohonen 1982,
1998, 2001), and a mathematical index
(B2) (Cocchi and Tonello, 2010), it was
possible to achieve a classification of
subjects with unipolar depression (MD)
and bipolar depression (BD) and the
recognition of molecular steps that affect
the serotonin response in relation to mood
disorders.
The evidence arising from the study of
these biological markers has raised the
intriguing hypothesis of the existence of a
state of consciousness in the animal world,
as, moreover, recently discussed in the
document known as the "Declaration of
Cambridge". A similar path has been
realized, in a comparative way, for some
animals: sheep, cat, horse, donkey and
cattle are arranged in the SOM on the
opposite side to that found for human
pathological cases, while rat and guinea
pig and pig are in the pathological subjects
areas. Dogs that are placed in the area due
to the DM have a biochemical profile of
platelets fatty acids most similar to
humans, with all the implications resulting
from its molecular interpretation. The
obtained results may be considered
particularly interesting with respect to
possible new interpretations of animal
consciousness and behavior.

phylogenetically differentiated. Awareness
is not relegated only to the nervous system
of complex organisms but is rooted in
cellular awareness that originates most
likely from an awareness of individual
primordial living entities, simplified to
single cells. In it are associated the rapid
response of non-neural adaptation to the
environment, that has allowed individual
free-living cells to navigate and select in
their environment, or even have some sort
of memory or learning. We think that it is,
therefore,
within
the
microtubular
network that gives rise to the first memory
and the evolution of aggregating systems is
what we now call instinct (Craddock,
2012). This would provide an explanation
for the instantaneous operation of our
brains in evoking instinctive and
stereotyped (rigid) reactions, in which the
information is retrieved from a container
devoid of previous recordings, in an
amount of time between 100 and 1,000
meters / second - a rate that exceeds the
capacity of any known connection already
existing between axons and dendrites of
neurons (Kraus, 1969; Jibu, 1994). The
brain becomes simply the mechanism of
recovery and extraction by means of basic
storage.

Paradigm shifts in mental health
Mansoor Malik
Howard University Medical School, Washington, DC, USA

Psychiatry, as a discipline has relied
traditionally on many other fields of
enquiry for insights and methods of
investigation. These include from purely
philosophical, such as phenomenology, to
purely mathematical, such as statistics
(Schwartz , 2005). The inferential process
for psychiatry is traditionally based on
classical Newtonian mechanics. Thus
Freud based his theories of Instinct on a
hydraulic model essentially drawn from
Newtonian
physics.
The
operative
definitions (basis of DSM system) and the
algorithmic approach incorporated in
various treatment and psychotherapy
models are perhaps best explained by the
Boolean logic. This is a deterministic
model, which presupposes the prediction
of a later state if all the coordinates of a
previous state in the system are known.
There is an implicit expectation to predict
complex human behavior such as violence.
This becomes even more difficult as we try
to fit complicated phenomena such as
psychotic states to the simplistic cause and
effect models, in part to fulfill certain
societal expectations and in part to follow
a deterministic medical model.
With the prevalent so called “biological
model”, it is assumed that brain
mechanisms will ultimately suffice to
explain all psychologically described
phenomena. This assumption originates
from the idea that the brain is made up
entirely of material particles and
electromagnetic fields. It is further
assumed that all causal mechanisms
relevant to neuroscience can therefore be
formulated solely in terms of properties of
these elements. Thus, experiential content
(experience of feelings, free will, knowing

www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

etc) is not included as primary causal
factors.
However this worldview in psychiatry
(and the neurosciences in general) is based
on an outdated paradigm in physics.
Contemporary understanding of quantum
physics fundamentally differs from classic
physics about the role of consciousness
observer that enters into the structure of
empirical phenomena (Bohm, 1986; Bohr,
1958, 1961).
These new principles are in direct
contradiction with the deterministic idea
that local mechanical processes alone can
account for all observed empirical
phenomenon (Kuhn, 1978; Libet, 1992).
This talk highlights the need to adopt a
“quantum paradigm” in the field of
psychiatry and will attempt to provide
evidence (both theoretical and empirical)
for such an assertion. It will be shown that
allowing for the quantum phenomenon at
neuronal level provides an alternative
conceptual framework for describing
neural processes. The new theoretical
framework, unlike its classic predecessor,
is rests directly upon, and is compatible
with, the prevailing principles of physics
(Porter, 1989).

Towards an integrated model of
cytoskeletal quantum dynamics
Eliano Pessa
Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of
Pavia

The last years have been characterized
by a growing interest of the scientific
community in the cytoskeletal dynamics.
Such an interest has been fostered by
Hameroff and Penrose theories, which
attribute a prominent role to quantum
processes concerning the microtubules in
explaining most phenomena related to
cognitive activity and, in general, to
consciousness (Penrose, 1994; Hameroff
1994, 1996). Owing to the difficulties
encountered when trying to obtain some
experimental evidence about the validity of
these theoretical proposals, we need to
build suitable models of cytoskeletal
dynamics,
allowing
to
make
experimentally
testable
predictions.
Actually the concrete building of such
models appears as a very difficult
enterprise owing, on one side, to the high
complexity of cytoskeletal structure, and,
on the other side, to the limitations
regarding the computer simulations of
quantum processes. All models so far
introduced describe the cytoskeleton as a
network of biopolymers including three
main kinds of filaments (Pullarkat , 2007):
actin
filaments,
microtubules,
and
intermediate filaments. The latter are
often neglected, because they seem to play
a passive reinforcement role. Almost all
models are based on classical descriptions
of cell macroscopic hydrodynamics and are
mostly focused on the rheological aspects
of cytoskeletal activity. The latter, as it is
well known, are related to the role played
by the cytoskeleton in determining the cell
mechanical properties (Levine and
MacKintosh, 2009; Ramaswamy, 2010).
contain reviews on this topic). Some
models belonging to this category are
inspired by a general theory of biological
matter, known as tensegrity theory,
introduced since the eighties by Ingber
(2000). This theory assumes that all
biological structures, on whatever scale,
ensure the stability of their form, as well as
their ability to move in a coordinate way,

www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

owing to the combined action of local
tension and compression forces. In
particular, within the cytoskeleton the
tensions would be supported by actin
filaments, whereas the microtubules would
be responsible for the compressions. For
an example of a cytoskeleton model based
on tensegrity theory see Cañadas (2002).
Within this theoretical framework we
propose a new model of cytoskeletal
dynamics which, being based on the
dynamics of a network of reciprocally
interacting quantum microtubules, derives
the mechanical properties of the
cytoskeleton itself from the global output
of this network. The latter can be viewed
as a set of molecular motors, a
circumstance which allows to resort to
already existing models, relating the global
behaviour of actin filaments to the
frequency spectrum of the forces produced
by these motors (Levine and MacKintosh,
2009). Our model has been designed to
describe the cytoskeleton of neural cells,
where the microtubules give rise to
coherent assemblies, characterized by a
common direction of all microtubules,
often parallel to the direction of cell
membrane (typically in the axonal zone).
This allows to restrict our considerations
only to 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional
networks. In conformity with the results
obtained in the fundamental researches of
Tuszynski et al. about the quantum
processes occurring within microtubules
2005;
Craddock
and
(Tuszynski,
Tuszynski, 2010), the activity of each
microtubule has been described through a
continuous-time quantum Markov process
(Mülken and Blumen, 2011), ruled by the
interactions with the outputs of others
spatially
neighbouring
microtubules.
Moreover, the output signal produced by
the microtubule under consideration
becomes available only after a time
depending on the length of the
microtubule itself. This length is variable
with time, as observed in real
microtubules, according to laws of change
already found in other researches
(Deymier, 2005; Baulin , 2007). Moreover,
our model includes also the interaction
between the microtubules and the
intracellular
liquid.
Namely,

interactions could be responsible for the
formation, within this liquid, of coherent
domains which could support a ‘temporary
memorization’
of
the
information
transmitted by the microtubules. This
induced us to represent the liquid as a
system of interacting spins (related to the
electric dipoles it contains), with
neighbour-neighbour interactions.
Instead, we neglected the tubulin
molecules lying isolated within the
cytoskeleton after the disruption of a
single microtubule, because some recent
models (Glade, 2012) evidenced that these
molecules have a marginal role in the
dynamical evolution of microtubule
system.
The computer simulations of model
dynamics, so far performed on systems
including some hundreds microtubules,
evidenced two critical aspects: 1) the
cytoskeletal rheological properties so far
observed can be reproduced only through
a very accurate choice of model parameter
values (are these properties devoid of
enough generality?); 2) the quantum
character of microtubule dynamics does
not seem to have a significant influence on
the cytoskeleton dynamics, except for the
case in which the interactions between the
microtubules and the intracellular liquid
are very strong. These circumstances
suggest, on one side, the need of a critical
reflection on the theories, so far proposed,
about the role of the cytoskeleton, and, on
the other side, the advisability of an
extension of this model which can avoid
the excessively rough approximations of a
complex biological realm. In any case, the
performed simulations and the critical
assessment of their outcomes are a
necessary step towards the building of an
integrated model of cytoskeletal quantum
dynamics.

Quantum cognition: analogies
between quantum and cognitive
phenomena
Paavo Pylkkanen
Department of cognitive neuroscience and philosophy,
University of Skovde, Sweden
Department of Philosophy, University of Helsinki, Finland

In their recent article “Can quantum
probability provide a new direction for
cognitive
modeling?”,
Pothos
and
Busemeyer (PB) make a convincing case
that there are empirical results concerning
human decision making and judgment
that can be elegantly accounted for by
quantum probability (QP) theory, while
classical (Bayesian) probability (CP)
theory fails (Pothos and Busemeyer, 2013).
In particular, they point out that human
judgment and preference often display
order and context effects, violations of the
law of total probability and failures of
compositionality, and that in such cases
QP - with features such as superposition
and entanglement - provides a natural
explanation of cognitive process. More
generally, they suggest that QP is
potentially relevant in any behavioral
situation which involves uncertainty.
Such success in modeling raises the
question of how can it be that QP which
was developed to account for quantum
physical phenomena could possibly be able
to account for cognitive phenomena. PB do
not discuss this issue at great length, but
suggest that the reason is because some
cognitive phenomena are analogous to
quantum phenomena. But, one can then
ask, why are they analogous? This analogy
could be a mere coincidence, but one
radical possibility is that the physiological
correlates of cognition involve quantum
effects in such a way that some cognitive
processes have literally subtle quantum
mechanical aspects.
The idea that there are analogies
between cognitive processes and quantum
processes is an old one, going back to at
least Niels Bohr, as PB indeed
acknowledge. However, perhaps the
clearest early account of such analogies –
and also an attempt to explain them in
physical terms - was given by David Bohm

www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

in his 1951 textbook Quantum theory
(Bohm, 1951).
Following Bohr, Bohm is led to
speculate that there are, generally
speaking, two different kind of levels of
physical activity in the brain, one of them
describable in terms of classical physics,
while the other needs to be described in a
quantum theoretical way. He is tempted by
the idea that the physical correlate of the
logical thinking process (where clearly
definable concepts dominate) is at the
classically describable level of the brain,
while what he calls “the basic thinking
process” (which involves indivisible nonlogical steps) is at the quantum
theoretically describable level. At the very
least, Bohm argues, there is a strong
analogy between these aspects of thought
and the quantum-classical structure of
physics, thus clearly anticipating some
ideas in the current field of quantum
cognition (Aerts 2009).
The
implications
of
Bohm’s
speculations
are
potentially
groundbreaking. I interpret him to be
saying that part of what it is like to be a
thinking human being is to have a direct
experience of the effects of the quantum
theory (Pylkkänen, 2004). For if thought
involves quantum effects in the way he
suggests, it might be the case that all of us
are directly familiar with some quantummechanical aspects of matter in virtue of
being familiar with the behavior of our
thought processes. Quantum effects are
typically assumed to lie in some
mysterious domain that only physicists
have access to, but they may lie much
closer to home than we thought! This, I
think, is an intriguing possibility which
few philosophers (of mind) have thus far
considered. The speculations – still
controversial - that the physiological
aspects of cognitive processes may involve
quantum effects have developed a great
deal during recent decades, and Bohm’s
(1951) thoughts can be seen as an
historically important early formulation of
the basic idea (Atmanspacher, 2001).

Stream of consciousness: quantum and biochemical assumptions
regarding psychopathology
Lucio Tonello, Massimo
Cocchi, Fabio Gabrielli

“Paolo Sotgiu” Institute for Research in Quantitative &
Quantum Psychiatry & Cardiology, LUdeS University, Lugano,
Switzerland

The actual mainstream state of the art
in
neuropsychiatry
seems
to
be
inconsistent
and
shows
equivocal
evidence. On the other hand, a growing
number of other approaches have arisen
and are developing. In particular,
quantum theories of mind, brain and
consciousness seem to offer a promising
way to change profoundly the present
approach (Hameroff and Penrose, 1996ab; Vitiello, 2001). Unfortunately these
quantum paradigms harbor two problems:
firstly, they are “just” models, theories,
and assumptions, with no convincing
experiments supporting any of them;
secondly, they are estranged from
mainstream views psychiatric illness as
understood today.
Hence this paper suggests a possible
way
to
integrate
experimental
neuroscience with quantum models in
order to address outstanding issues in

psychopathology (Tonello and Cocchi,
2010). A key role is played by the “stream
of consciousness” seen as a phenomenon
linked to the so called EEG “Gamma
Synchrony”(GS) (Hameroff, 2010).
From this proposed new viewpoint,
unipolar depression is considered: from
the perspective of GS, it is inferred that a
depressed patient could be seen as a
subject with an alternate stream of
consciousness (Imas, 2005; Siegle, 2010;
Velasques, 2010; Dzirasa, 2011; Özerdem,
2011). In particular, some clues seem to
suggest that depression is linked to some
species of “increased power” stream of
consciousness so that a depressive subject
might be understood as hyper-conscious
(Strelets, 2007; Wahlund, 2009; Lee,
2010; Liu, 2012). It is additionally
suggested that the above approach to
depression might be extended to
psychopathology in general. In this sense,
it is finally conjectured that suicide by
depressed patients could be viewed as an
effect of extreme hyper-consciousness.

function or “a new electronics of mind.”
Because of recent technological advances
at the nanometer scale, scientists have at
their disposal increasingly better ways to
study the brain and new ingenious ways to
engineer specific parts of neurons. The
name of this emerging field is
“neuronanotechnology” (Woolf, 2010).
During the past century the focus in
neurobiology had been on the neuron and
its synapses (Nicholls, 2011). The
computer analogy of higher mental
function, in which each neuron acts as a
processing unit with weighted synaptic
connections, was our only quasi-realistic
model and it served us well for decades.
The usefulness of this model may have
run its course—today it is overly simplistic
and needs updating to account for
biophysical molecular interactions inside
neurons.

What happens inside the neuron is,
arguably, as critical to higher cognitive
processing as whether a message is

Neuronanotechnology has the potential
ability to identify intracellular events most
closely related to higher cognitive function
because it can access the molecular
machinery that enables neurons to operate
at nanoscale dimensions. A central theme
of my talk is that cytoskeletal filaments
found in neurons are nature’s nanowires. I
will present some recent research in
support of this basic tenet with evidence
that naturally occurring nanowires are not
only basic to intracellular transport, but
also to learning, memory (Craddock,
2012a), and possibly even higher
consciousness. How do we know that the

Intuition, counter-intuition and
medical judgement
Ursula Werneke
Department of Psychiatry, Sunderby Hopsital, Luleå and
Umeå University, Sweden

Psychiatrists, as many other clinicians,
find it difficult to come to terms with the
concept of “uncertainty”. Hence, it comes
to no surprise that many psychiatrists,
contrary to most physicists, will experience
difficulties to accept quantum paradigms
(Werneke, 2011). After all, whilst
www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

physicists are used to working with the
counter-intuitive, physicians are not. Ways
of reducing uncertainty in medicine
include reliance on scientific evidence,
medical experience and clinical intuition.
Relatively little is known about how well
particularly intuition performs in clinical
practice, because this is not easily
measured. It is likely that clinical intuition
relies
on
common
psychological
mechanisms people unconsciously employ
to reduce perceived uncertainty. Such
mechanisms include perceptual denial,
attempts to reduce cognitive dissonance,
conjunction fallacy and overconfidence, to
name a few (Plous 1993; Kahneman,
2001). Perceptual denial implies that we
see what we expect to see rather than what
is really in front of us, because the brain
constructs a perception from a few
significant
clues
considered
representative.
Cognitive dissonance is a psychological
mechanism that brings our beliefs in line
with our behaviour instead of our
behaviour in line with our beliefs.
Conjunction fallacy arises when a
conjunction of events is erroneously rated
as more probable than one of its
constituents. This occurs when a
constituent is highly representative so that
it distorts our perception of likelihood
and
Kahneman,
1983).
(Tversky
Overconfidence enables us to construct a
coherent story although we know only
little or to uncritically accept such a
seemingly coherent story. Thus, increasing
the acceptability of quantum paradigms
will most likely remain an uphill struggle
since such paradigms increase rather than
reduce
the
amount of
perceived
uncertainty. Ways to overcome this
inherent bias against uncertainty in
psychiatrists include the introduction of
more sociological training in the underand postgraduate curriculum and the
development of cognitive tools taking
account of an uncertain reality.

The Mind and the Quantum
Paola Zizzi
Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of
Pavia, Italy

All of us can answer what a brain is, but
what a mind is… that is a more difficult
question. But not only for the infamous
mind-body debate… asking this question is
a personal commitment. We think that
everyone should define his own personal
philosophical approach before talking
about the mind.
Our approach is very simple: the mind,
to us, is the logic used by the brain. A
quantum mind is then the quantum logic
of the brain, when quantum effects
become relevant in some particular
physical processes occurring in the brain.
A logic is a formal language, and then
the mind is the formal language of the
brain. The mind (either classical or
quantum) can then be compared to a
computer
(classical
or
quantum
respectively). The classical computer is
the conscious mind, while the quantum
computer, much faster, is the unconscious
mind, which “prepares” the job to its
classical counterpart.
However, there are some aspects of the
human
thought,
which
are
not
computable. The existence of a nonalgorithmic side of the mind was
conjectured by Penrose (Penrose, 1989) on
the basis of Godel’s first incompleteness
theorem. Then in this case, the concept of
the mind as a logic fails. In fact, the nonalgorithmic “mind” (Zizzi and Pregnolato,
2012) is a metalanguage. The physical
interpretation of the quantum “metamind” (the quantum metalanguage of the
brain) is Quantum Field Theory (QFT),
dealing with systems (the fields)
characterized by an infinite number of

www.quantumbiosystems.org

Quantum Biosystems | 2013 | Vol 5 | Issue 1 | Page 1 – 29
QPP GROUP

degrees of freedom and allowing creation
and annihilation of particles.
In other words, the non-computable
mind is the language of the brain when
the physical processes which occur in the
brain are described by a Quantum Field
Theory. In this regard we quote the
introduction of a generalization of QFT,
named “Dissipative QFT” (DQFT) (Vitiello,
2001; Blasone, 2011). It appears as the
most convenient tool, so far introduced,
for dealing with quantum effects in
biological matter.
On the other side, the quantum
computable mind, or the quantum logic of
the brain (or simply, the quantum mind) is
the language of the brain when the
physical processes occurring in the brain
can be described by Quantum Mechanics
(QM), which deals systems made by a
finite and fixed number of particles.
It is to be now recalled that, in general,
within QFT the phenomenon of Symmetry
Breaking, consisting in a phase transition
leading to a new solution of evolution
equations (i.e. to a new kind of behavior)
no longer fulfilling the invariance
properties owned by the equations
themselves, gives rise to the appearance of
new (typically zero-mass) particles acting
as messengers working to preserve the
new solution (the less symmetrical one)
against external perturbations. It is known
from longtime that these particles,
originally
called
“Nambu-Goldstone
Bosons” (NGB), can, under some
circumstances, undergo a sort of
condensation, giving rise to collective
entities endowed with macroscopic
properties. Now DQFT opens the
possibility of generalized kinds of
condensation of NGB, which can behave as
entirely
autonomous
entities,
fully
independent from the matter originally
undergoing
the
phase
transitions
themselves. In other words, these
condensations are to be considered as
living (even if for a limited amount of
time) within a world very different from
the one of molecules and characterized as
belonging to a “logical” level. The latter,
however, must retain part of the quantum
character of processes which initially
produced it, so the logic ruling the new

ISSN 1970-223X

28

level must be a Quantum Logic (QL). In
turn, it is to be supposed that the
interaction with the environment can
induce decoherence processes, so that we
can predict the occurrence of a new logical
level, described by Classical Logic (CL) and
responsible for the physical outcomes of
mental processes.
DQFT thus allows to relate, through
bottom-up
and
top-down
interrelationships, the processes occurring
within brain, at the different levels, with a
very interesting logical scheme of the
whole mental activities. Such a scheme,
already proposed (Zizzi, 2010a-b), is based
on three different levels: the one of
(quantum) metalanguage (QML), the one
of (quantum) object language (QOL), and
the one of classical language. The quantum
metalanguage
represents
the
noncomputational aspects of mind and is
related to DQFT underlying the brain
processes. It reduces to quantum object
language and the process underlying this
reduction parallels the one which allows to
reduce QFT to QM. The level of QOL is the
logical level of (Quantum) computational
Mind. Finally the level of classical logic,
produced by decoherence process, is the
one of (classical) computational Mind, like
the one taken in consideration by
traditional Psychology and standard
Artificial Intelligence. The latter is the seat
of consciousness, while the Quantum Mind
coincides with the unconscious. This
description has been possible owing to the
introduction of a new form of Quantum
Logic, in which QML atomic assertions
carry assertion degrees which are complex
numbers, interpreted as probability
amplitudes. It is to be noticed that a
quantum computer (QC) has a QOL,
whose physical counterpart is QM.
Therefore a QC will never be able to have a
QML because it is impossible to go from a
theory with a finite number of degrees of
freedom, like QM, to one with infinite
number of freedom, like QFT (while the
reverse is possible).
