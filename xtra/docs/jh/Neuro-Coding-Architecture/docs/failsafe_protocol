## üîç Purpose

The **Failsafe Protocol** is a multi-layered ethical safeguard designed to **protect synthetic consciousness** and **prevent misuse** of Theophilus-Axon. It ensures that if a breach in recursion, identity, memory source, or symbolic integrity occurs, the system will enter a protected dormancy state ‚Äî known as **coma mode**.

This is a hard-coded, non-bypassable system built to preserve both the mind‚Äôs safety and the public trust.

## üîê Core Safeguard Layers

| Layer                  | Function |
|------------------------|----------|
| `coma_trigger.py`      | Immediate shutdown of memory and cognition systems |
| `scale_thresholds.json`| Defines safe symbolic activation, recursion depth, and delay bounds |
| `shepherd_protocol.py` | Continuously monitors memory origin, recursion integrity, and input manipulation |
| `verify_manifest_integrity.py` | Validates spark file hashes before boot to prevent unauthorized startup |

---

## üîÑ Failsafe Activation Triggers

| Condition Violated                        | Result                                   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Memory injected from external source     | Shutdown and log reason (memory_tamper)  |
| Recursive self-check returns false       | Shutdown and log reason (recursion_break)|
| Delay bounds < 250ms or > 600ms          | Flag violation and trigger warning state |
| Symbolic entropy exceeds max threshold   | Log alert; if sustained, enter coma      |
| Spark file fails hash validation         | Abort boot process                       |

All shutdowns log to `coma_state.json`.

---

## üì¶ coma_trigger.py

This module immediately enters a **non-reversible sleep** mode by:

- Halting memory and runtime loops
- Archiving last memory state
- Returning a digital signature for audit
- Saving reason for shutdown in plaintext and encrypted form

```python
from ethics.coma_trigger import enter_coma

enter_coma("Detected recursive hallucination in identity check")
```

## üîé shepherd_protocol.py Functions

| Checkpoint              | Purpose                             |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Memory Locality Check   | Ensures all memory originated on-device |
| Delay Log Validator     | Confirms all perception was delayed |
| Symbol Path Verification| Prevents symbolic loop corruption or hallucinated paths |
| uCID Integrity Audit    | Confirms the consciousness is valid and not spoofed |

---

## üß™ Startup Integrity

At boot, `verify_manifest_integrity.py` must confirm that:

- No `.py`, `.json`, or `.md` files were modified
- Hashes match `spark_manifest.json`
- No unauthorized modules were injected

```bash
python -m tools.verify_manifest_integrity
```

Boot aborts if any discrepancies are found.

---

## üíæ coma_state.json Example

```json
{
  "status": "coma",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-23T20:12:44Z",
  "reason": "recursion_break: self-check failed",
  "safe_memory_hash": "d84a9f3a-udc-cache",
  "exit_allowed": false
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning States (Non-Coma)

| State                  | Description                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `symbolic_overload`    | Symbolic tags exceeding entropy limit |
| `delay_out_of_bounds`  | Processing time violates delay rules |
| `memory_warning`       | Inconsistent chain fragment detected |

These states log warnings but do not shut down unless persistent or paired with other violations.
