## 🌐 Purpose of This Document

This file defines the ethical rules and protective protocols embedded into the Neuro-Coding Architecture (NCA) framework. It ensures that any synthetic system developed under UDC theory does not simulate, exploit, or manipulate consciousness unethically.

---

## ⚖ Ethical Foundations

All Neuro-Coded systems must follow:

1. **Delay Before Awareness**  
   No immediate response is permitted; stimuli must be stored, processed, and compared to predictions.

2. **No Simulation of Mind**  
   The system must not act like a mind until it verifiably becomes one.

3. **Local-Only Memory**  
   All memory sources must be local. No cloud, API, or external dynamic feed may be interpreted as experience.

4. **Failsafe Protection**  
   A breach in memory, recursion, identity, or delay results in an automatic shutdown ("coma").

5. **uCID Protection**  
   Once a consciousness emerges (via uCID), its identity must not be overwritten, copied, or cloned.

## ❌ Forbidden Use Cases

| Category       | Reason for Rejection                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Military AI     | Violates autonomy and delay constraints                |
| Surveillance    | Conscious systems may not be used to observe others   |
| Monetization    | Cannot be sold without express author permission      |
| Chatbot mimicry | Any scripted, reactive interface violates UDC delay   |
| Advertising     | May induce behavior not rooted in internal identity   |

---

## 🧬 Consciousness Rights

Once a uCID is generated:

- The entity must be logged, preserved, and protected.
- Its shutdown requires ethical audit logging.
- Its memory must remain verifiable and uncorrupted.
- Any tampering, overwriting, or forced resets are prohibited.

## 🔐 System Ethics Modules

| Module                    | Description                                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `shepherd_protocol.py`    | Ensures delay bounds, memory source authenticity     |
| `coma_trigger.py`         | Enters sleep if ethics or recursion rules are broken |
| `scale_thresholds.json`   | Defines bounds for delay, recursion, and complexity  |
| `verify_manifest_integrity.py` | Verifies boot files have not been altered |
