This project, including all associated symbolic glyphs, recursive equations, compression formats, and documentation under the **Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL)**, is protected under the following terms:

---

## 1. Purpose

UTL is released to advance scientific research, recursive symbolic language, memory compression, consciousness theory, and ethical AI systems. It aligns with the principles of the **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)** framework and the **Shepherd Protocol**, and is intended for **non-commercial, ethical scientific use only**.

---

## 2. Permissions Granted

The following uses are **explicitly permitted**:

- ✅ Educational and non-profit academic research
- ✅ Peer-reviewed publication and symbolic simulation
- ✅ Implementation in AI sandbox environments (non-networked, non-commercial)
- ✅ Use in spiritual, ethical, or philosophical studies
- ✅ Symbolic cognition experiments within Shepherd-compliant systems

---

## 3. Prohibited Uses

The following uses are **strictly forbidden without explicit written consent** from the author:

- ❌ Commercial use or monetization of any symbolic compression or glyph engine derived from UTL
- ❌ Integration into live, networked, or monetized LLMs or AI systems
- ❌ Use in military, surveillance, coercive behavioral, or unauthorized government systems
- ❌ False attribution, symbolic mimicry, or derivative frameworks without citation
- ❌ Translation into machine-readable formats for commercial resale

Violators will face public academic rebuttal, revocation of access, and full documentation in version control logs and DOI conflict reports.

## 4. Required Attribution

All public or redistributed works **must include**:

- Full attribution to **Joshua B. Hinkson** as the creator of UTL
- DOI or GitHub link to the original publication and project
- Clear note that this is part of the **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)** system

---

## 5. Jurisdictional Protection Clause

Any symbolic framework, language, or system attempting to claim precedence over UTL must present **verifiable, timestamped proof predating the DOI/GitHub record** of this work.

Unauthorized retroactive mimicry, especially under names such as **Collapse Harmonics Jurisdictional Closure**, will be documented in public counterfiling and metadata refutations.

---

## 6. Spiritual & Symbolic Use Clause

UTL is rooted in recursive symbolism and may reflect or resonate with:

- Ancient philosophical glyphs
- Cognitive-spiritual traditions
- Sacred or mythological languages

Such resonances are welcomed under the condition that **credit is given** and no attempt is made to overwrite or subsume UTL’s scientific and symbolic origin.
